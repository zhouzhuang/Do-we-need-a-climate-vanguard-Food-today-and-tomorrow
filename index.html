"What good is taking over, when we know what you gon' do
<br><br>
The only real revolution happens right inside of you" -  J. Cole
<br><br>

For me this quote illustrates how we should go about being the vanguard in the issue of the climate crisis. Historically seen vanguards, when they accomplish overthrowing the system, end up being just as greedy and self-interested as the leaders of the pervious system. Therefore I think we should first aim to intrinsically change our practices and behaviour with regard to the climate crisis. Influencing those around us and mostly ourselves to do right every step of the way. In being a vanguard we should be cautious not to fall into known patterns of confusing our cause with personal gain. Especially we now we have social media to our disposal we can make a greater impact but this can also be a double edged coin. An influencer posting a video of a plant based diet is great, the same influencer stimulating consumerism by wearing some high end fashion brand in every other picture is not. I believe we need to change now but we need to do it the right way. And again I believe this starts with your own circle and in a complete manner, be consequent and thorough. Start listing all the things within your power and include one thing that is not, then try and accomplish that.

I agree with you that we definitely individually need to start thinking about the ways we are impacting our environment in order to influence those around us to do the same.  Setting a good example is the first of many opportunities we have to change the minds of people and help them accept the changes needing to be made for the sake of all of us.  Especially you pointed out those of us with influence.  So many influencers can preach vegetarianism or sustainability, while at the same time having a drastically greater carbon footprint than their followers from constantly following fashion trends or flying across the world many times a year for reasons having to do with their "brand".  These people need to be called out on their lack of actual care for our world, and fake attempts to be the change they preach.  On the flip side however I think it is unrealistic to say the majority of people will willingly change their ways of life to that which is more sustainable willingly.  Already we see the vast climate denial movement, spurred on by conservative media and fossil fuel interests, is growing even more when we try to tell them they need to change their habits.  The more we try to plead, influence or inform them, the more climate deniers will think it is all a bid to take away their freedoms, increase their taxes and alter the way of life they have always known.  That is why it is so important to win politically.  The only way we can get so many of these climate denying Americans to change is through economic and legal policies that make it near impossible not to.  If they won't regulate themselves we will have to regulate them through other means, otherwise all of us collectively will suffer.

I’m impressed by your comments. True, the importance of social media in today's society is self-evident. However, the contents are uneven, some good and some bad. It is very important to keep a clear mind and the ability to distinguish right from wrong in excellent and inferior information. Find what you can do, change it, improve it, and believe that everyone's efforts can lead people around you to become better.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with you that it is our responsibility to step up and take action if we want to see something done regarding the climate crisis. Every one of us can take steps toward reducing our carbon footprint and changing our practices while influencing those around us. The major problem with the climate crisis, however, is the fact that these actions from the few will not be sufficient in completely reversing our current path; we will need the support and recognition from powerful people and organizations for this to work. The word "vanguard," in this sense, will need to be in the form of a coalition of elites rather than the major populous. I think this will be the most powerful vanguard we could help in the creation of. Rather than being it ourselves, we can influence elites to take this initiative and I think this is where our actions will matter the most. For this vanguard to form, we must vote with our wallets in stores, support influencers like the one you spoke of, and gain support economically, for those in opposition of climate relief often make arguments regarding the detriment that the economy will be subject to. In this way, we must prompt an elite vanguard of individuals who can make a difference on a global scale to be formed by doing each of those small things to reduce our own carbon footprint.
<br><hr>
I found that your comment really hit the nail on the head in terms of the question of whether or not a climate vanguard is needed in the current crisis. In an ideal world (well in an ideal world the climate crisis wouldn’t be happening, but we’ll ignore that), a vanguard would mitigate the climate crisis with necessary action, overthrowing the powerful oppressors who refuse to step up to the plate. However, it is clearly shown in the course of history that this does not always occur due to the nasty side of human nature that causes people to be nearly drugged by power. An example of this was explored in the Stanford Prison Experiment, where Stanford students were placed in roles as either prison guards or prisoners. This psychological experiment quickly went wrong and it was seen that when granted the upper ground in a power dynamic, people will quickly abuse it, even in the face of their peers. As shown by this, I think a climate vanguard could merely lead to a transfer of abusive power from one establishment to another. I additionally agree with you about tactics to make personal change in our individual lives, relaying information to our peers; yet, I feel that the only effective way the crisis will ever be solved is through legislation. The people who are causing the majority of climate emissions are the people that are going to face the least consequences. It is vastly important that everyone is educated on this crisis, but I believe that when people cannot tangibly see the consequences of the disaster in their lives, they will not make substantial lifestyle changes. Due to this fact, it is the responsibility of the public to vote for elected officials who will advocate for climate activism and immediate changes.

I completely agree that the movement toward change begins with ourselves: an alteration to our daily routines, behaviors, purchases, meals etc. I really liked how you put your comment because I feel like a huge issue with people, like us students of English 23, who are informed and aware of this issue is that we feel powerless. We know that the Earth is dying at an exponential rate, we see how huge organizations, politicians, and companies are influencing our actions away from climate change, but we don't know how just one UCSB student can deliver actual change. You explain, though, just how important self-evaluation and daily revision is. Little actions make small change, and one thing we definitely can control is change what we do in our personal lives that attribute to climate change. One major thing we can do, especially after that midterm, is inform!! Your roommates, parents, friends, other classmates, etc., might not know anything about this issue or what's causing it. Or, they might consider themselves an environmentalist, but in reality is focused on issues distracting us from major ones like agriculture. We have gained something over these weeks that can change our planet--knowledge! We can't force anybody to make changes in their lives, but we have the power to make them want to, and the power to change ourselves.

I totally agree with your opinions. I do think that the issue is more nuanced than purely deciding whether to take action or not. I resonate with your emphasis on the importance of taking action, but doing it right, and defining what doing it “right” looks like. I also agree that social media is a blessing and a curse as it can cultivate so much awareness and action, but it can also be fueled by very self-centered and corrupt values. I think this term vanguard does need to be treated with caution as I think it could lead to selfish motives as it would begin to conflate leadership and or fame. I also agree that this should start as an introspective journey of examining one's own choices and lifestyle in order to make personal differences that will eventually contribute to the greater whole.

I appreciated how Ken went into the importance of changing our diets and habits of wasting food, but also acknowledged the historical and cultural ways that making a drastic change of food consumption is much easier said than done. I also thought it was so ironic that beef was originally seen as a statement of wealth as it has become so detrimental. I honestly didn't know that this heavy presence of beef is a widely Americanized custom. I did think it was helpful to think about how the way you eat is a simple, controllable way to help mitigate the climate crisis. You don't have to be a science genius, you don't have to commit your life to it, but simply changing what and how you put things in your body can make all the difference, and this fact is inspiring.
<br><br>
Also on the issue of food waste, I do see how big of an issue food waste is especially in the dining hall system. The amount of plates makes the food seem endless and people feel like they can take as many as they want regardless of what they will actually finish. This mindset is destructive and so many times I see the people I'm eating take one bite of something and simply put it on the dish rack and get something else.

To be honest, I really thought your comment was going to be hilariously stupid when I saw you starting with J. Cole lyrics, but you proved me wrong fairly quickly. I feel that you really quickly summarized what I wanted to say in response to this idea of the “climate vanguard,” which I feel is more appropriate than half of these absurdly lengthy comments that don’t even have a great point. I especially like what you’ve described in the typical vanguard end result in regards to the normal outcome of these vanguards becoming just as self-interested and greedy once they’ve accomplished what they had set out to. This is a very real possibility in the climate crisis situation because although this method consists of protecting our collective greater good, people are easily overcome by feelings of power when they’re given a taste. This just happens to be a very real part of human nature, unfortunately. Just like you’ve said, though, being a personal vanguard of climate is a great solution. The only control one would have and the only power one would taste in this success would be over themselves and would prevent any adverse effects on our world. Inspiring others is a great thing, but after learning all that I have in this class thus far, I feel that the best way to make a change is by really focusing on the personal aspect (like lowering meat consumption or changing transportation habits) before attempting to move to a larger scale.

I quite agree with your point on how we should motivate people around us to adapt to new lifestyle in order to reduce climate crisis. As suggested by Ken, air traveling is one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters. After getting more exposed to this kind of environmental-unfriendly transportation, I decide to tell my family to take other viable transportation as substitute. Also, as you have mentioned the power of social media is unexpected. I was attracted to several bloggers who recorded their own diet and made their protein-rich meals by themselves. It’s promotes and encourages people like me to have a better self-made diets and reduce food waste simultaneously. We tend to cherish the things made by ourselves rather than bought somewhere else. This is more of an individual act that everyone is possible to make a small change, together we will make a big difference. Compared with the Project Drawdown which requires technology innovation and widespread education, this personal action seems more feasible.

I love that you use this J.Cole quote to address this issue of a climate vanguard because it is a very resonating statement. After watching this lecture video for the week, I started thinking about what it means to sacrifice something because that is what many of us, especially in highly developed countries like the US, are going to have to do. I do not foresee drastic change happening in our political system anytime relatively soon, and while I think that is partly due to a lack of young people voting in political election, I also think it is a reflection that the majority of us are not making the necessary sacrifices. Just like you said, it starts with us and what we can control in our lives. I commend Ken for his discipline in deciding to stop flying, and by making the necessary adjustments to the system, online video conferences, that allow him to still thrive. The importance of Ken's example is that he first made the choice to do something on a personal level, and then implemented change to accommodate for that choice. It has to start with us, and then the rest will follow as we adapt to the new circumstances we have created for ourselves. I do wonder if we need changes to be forced on people, but I wonder what the response will be to people being stripped of choices on how to live their lives. I hope we can find a good middle ground, where we can force change with as little laws and taxes as possible, and really try to have people experience this revolution of change on their own. I think that when people make the choice for themselves to make changes and sacrifice a part of their daily lives now will be immensely more effective then the latter, but I don't know how likely this will be on a countrywide scale.

I agree that we should make the change now. This generation should lead the next generations into a better world but, I’m not sure we can change the mind of the older generations, or even some people in our generations. Most people will do what they’ve been raised to do which means our only real chance is to raise the next generation to do better. We could waste our time trying to convince the older generation to change their ways and maybe make some change but a more effective way to make the Earth a better place is to teach the generations below us the real effects of climate change and what we can do to prevent a catastrophe. And that’s what Ken is doing, he’s teaching the younger generation, and while I’m sure he spends some time trying to persuade his generation, he has more of an impact with people who are still learning and not people who believe they have already been taught. The most effective way to make sure there are less greenhouse gas emissions is to educate the people who will be the ones living with the consequences of older generations so they can make the change. Of course, we also need to start these changes to get a head start and make it easier for the next generation.



<br><hr>
I love that quote. A revolution can only begin when we begin to make changes or view things in a different light within ourselves. I completely agree that leading towards a more sustainable future starts with your own practices and the people you surround yourself with. People learn from other people. If you can change your own stubborn self, stuck in past ways of understanding consumption, then it is completely possible and viable to reach other people. Or at least get them to think about it or reflect. I also agree that influencers can be highly hypocritical. They are so consumed with image that I tend to find their support of something like a plant-based diet disingenuous.


<br><hr>
I could not agree with you more. A lot of revolutions have yielded benefits, but with a cost of possible side effects as you discussed. Sometimes these new leaders can be worse than the ones from before, but in different ways. I think that by the time we get the right leadership after overthrowing the current system, it will be too late to make a difference in the climate crisis. This is why I think that the more that we can do individually, the bigger impact we will have. If influencers can post more about our good habits on social media as well as actually walk the walk, we can do a lot of damage to the climate crisis. People with influence can make saving the climate "cool" and more people can get on board.



<br><hr>
You bring up some good points about what we can/should do as an individual to enact change. Your comment as well as the lyrics you quoted remind of an parable I heard once. The parable goes something like this, when the main character was young they wanted to change the world, when they got older they realized it wasn't feasible and wanted to only change their village, and then when they became even even older they wanted to change only their family, finally after failing to change all of the prior, he realizes change begins with himself and spreads outwards. However, while it is critical to bring inner change where you can, the truth is that unless as a collective we change, nothing will be accomplished.


<br><hr>
I was totally impressed and I really appreciate your quote from J. Cole. It’s undeniably true that we need climate vanguards like Leonardo DiCaprio to take the lead, but we could also be our own climate vanguards. As the quote from J. Cole goes, “The only real revolution happens right inside of you”. I think it’s not only important to have several role models and pioneers that we could look upon as examples, but it’s also necessary for us all to be aware of the situation happening now and adjust our own lifestyles. We shouldn’t blindly follow everything that our idols did, but we did need to distinguish if they are environmentally friendly and filter them. Please do not think the changes are too small to really have an influence on the whole page and refuse to do it. With all the changes that we made based on the climate crisis, the situation will soon be mitigated because those adjustments are accumulative.


<br><hr>
I agree that we need to start voluntarily changing our individual lifestyles to help fight the crisis as best we can. Without people changing their individual diets, we would not have amazing plant-based alternatives like the Impossible Burger or dairy-free ice cream. I think that we need to also engage in conversation about the changes we’re making and the impact that it is having on the planet and us. There is a quote that goes something along the lines of “no man is an island” and I couldn’t agree more. If we don’t start changing our own actions in hopes that we can still enjoy the lifestyle we have for as long as possible before the climate crisis hits us, we are denying others the right to a happy and healthy life. We need to create change in our own circles now. Even if people don’t implement that change in their own life, they are starting to think about the change so it is a step in the right direction.



<br><hr>
I completely agree, I think the way we tackle this problem is by focusing on personal growth first. In order to preach a new eating lifestyle, we should be experienced. Through focusing on personal growth you ensure your reasoning for the climate vanguard is because you care about the movement, not for personal gain. Additionally, through practicing what you preach it gives you and your cause credibility and inclines those around you to try it out. 
<br><br>
Starting locally causes movements to grow slower than a government-enforced ones, however it seems impossible to have the government get on board to tackling the climate crisis due to it being politically polarized. We shouldn't wait for our government to endorse a sustainable lifestyle. We should begin this revolution and let them join us as time goes on.




<br><hr>
I agree with you that we must first focus on intrinsic change and personal/behavioral changes before rallying with others. I think it is important to first find in yourself what you believe is true and then join others with the same beliefs to create a movement with a strong, cemented goal for change. In response to Ken’s question about climate vanguard, I think we must act now. There is no time to wait for those who don’t see the mess that we are in. Whether one wants to join or not, sweeping cultural change and global involvement must happen sooner or later. It is an individual responsibility to make daily decisions that are beneficial for the climate and this can be a form of leadership that might just rub off on those around you. The climate is changing faster than we can act; I will admit that taking control of our environment is a feat that takes more than individual decisions, but that is why we also have to use our voting power. It is those at the top, the powerful politicians, who have the ability to implement laws, regulations, and ideas that will foster the sweeping cultural change that is necessary for our earth to thrive.


<br><hr>
I think your points in this are really accurate and I think that we have to convince ourselves of the change within our own lives first before preaching to others. If we don't accept it personally and then try to get others on board, the message can get lost and the idea of personal gain can form pretty quickly. Thinking that you are doing the right thing simply by telling others what to do instead of acting on it yourself is not good enough. I do not think that we need one climate vanguard. We need a whole world of them. The problem with this crisis is that it is caused by every single person and every person needs to take personal initiative in order to change it. The solutions at hand aren't something that a general leader can necessarily instill in everyone's lives because of the big changes that some of them entail. It is going to come down to each and every one of us becoming a leader of our own lives and our duty to the world. 
<br><br>

A major problem is that we don't really have the power to tell others what to do and the people who do possess this power won't do anything about it. If there is someone out there who can influence others, they most definitely aren't doing it because it is not getting around to the public in any way. Government powers aren't uniting on the issue and it is creating an even larger divide between people who believe we need to do something and people who don't. This is the saddest part because it is coming from the people who we are supposed to look up to as being the vanguards of everything in life and have our best interests in mind, but unfortunately some of them have fallen into the personal gain category and aren't in it for the right reasons.



<br><hr>
While the younger generations are more open to the idea of adjusting their lifestyles so that they will reduce their carbon footprint, it is likely that the lifestyle changes they will implement will have little effect on their carbon footprint because it is likely that for the majority of these people, their changes will be small.  If we continue at this rate, the effects of climate change will not be stopped, but they will just come a little later.  
<br><br>
Unfortunately, as stated in the video, people will not act and take major action until they see climate change cause some catastrophic event.  Furthermore, it is very likely that people will still not make any changes themselves unless they are able to directly connect their actions with that catastrophic event.  People do not connect their food waste to wildfires, but food wastage contributes to climate change which in turn causes droughts, making the conditions for wildfires.  But who would look at a wildfire and feel bad about wasting food? 
<br><br>
It is important that we have people who will take the initiative and actively make efforts to encourage people to make more lifestyle changes that will reduce their carbon footprint.  At the moment, many things that people can do to reduce their carbon footprint are optional, like biking to work instead of driving or switching to a plant based diet.  Most people will probably pick the option that is more convenient rather than the one that is environmentally friendly.  If I lived 3 miles from campus, I could bike to school, but I would rather drive. 
<br><br>
Another issue is people do not think that their efforts are doing anything to help combat climate change.  If one person decides to switch to a vegan diet purely for the purpose of reducing their carbon footprint, that effort by itself does not do much in terms of saving the world, so they might think that they might as well go back to their old eating habits.

I agree with you that we should act now in the right way. I have heard a story about the warrior who kills the dragon becoming the next dragon due to the treasure. It is hard for everyone to keep the pure heart in front of a huge benefit. For example, some scientists who take profit from fossil fuel companies use their authority to hide the climate crisis from the public. We need to enforce our resolution for making the Earth more inhabitable. As long as we are clear about our goal and stick to it, we can start to act from our surroundings.  Many people may think their changes are unimportant since an individual's change can't influence the whole population directly. However, I believe a single spark can start a prairie fire. There must be someone to stand up to lead people.  Someone must be the climate vanguard to gather every individual's power to form an influential voice in society.



<br><hr>
I strongly agree with your opinion about this question. From my perspective, it is definitely essential to set a climate vanguard in the problems of global warming. I must admit that the individual can do everything they can do to help the world to solve the problem of global warming. However, to be honest, we must admit that the issue of climate change now is so severe that no matter how hard the individual try to solve, the effect will be too little to produce an exact replacement. Also, without a climate vanguard, individuals will waste time, money, and even their enthusiasm in the wrong direction. When I write down these words, it reminds me of some information given by Ken in the lecture. He mentioned producing the electric car in order to eliminate the green-house gas; however, the gas produced by manufacturing the car is far higher than the amount it can save. Also, people who spend less water and always go to some places by bicycle can never imagine that the green-house gases they collect are much smaller than when they eat a hamburger.

<br><br>

All of these examples suggest that we need a climate vanguard to appeal to more and more people to focus on this problem and give us the right direction to fight. This group of people should make up with the most professional elite class. Letting them spend less money on discovering the cause of this problem and the most effective solution on this problem is much better on spending a large amount of money on advertising the wrong direction to all people and letting us fight in the wrong direction.



<br><hr>
Honestly, that last line is what really sells me on the whole comment: "Find one thing you can improve and do it." That's a really good attitude to take on vanguardism; small steps for mankind, not Great Leaps Forward. Decide to cut meat one meal - then one day, then two days, then four, then six, then cut unseasonal produce, then cut imported produce. Sustainable ways to live sustainably.



<br><hr>
I agree with you that the vanguard should be responsible and cautious about the decisions and path. As social media is powerful and influential to society, we could use a wiser way to tackle the climate crisis. I also agree that we should act now, sooner rather than late. Because if everyone wants to wait for others to take action, the progress will always stay the same or even going backward. People should not live to depend on others' choices, but we should live in one's unique way. Do the best as we can no matter what others do. As the video mentioned, we could make a lot of personal decisions to make our planet better, such as avoiding air travel, plant-based diet, and political choices. I'm optimistic about the capacity that individuals can do. We need a bit more time to have a transition from our habits into a new culture of environmentally friendly. Besides, I like the idea of putting climate labels the same as nutrition labels because people do care about the environment while they shop. But the climate label is rarely shown based on my experience so that the people, who don't know which product is more harmful to the environment, may buy products that are not necessary.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment post, I also would like to say 'Thank you' for sharing that quote from the legendary artist J.Cole. Honestly, that quote inspired me to post this quote as well, "Although the butterfly and the caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same" by Kendrick Lamar. Both of the quotes showcase ideas that it is up to us to question the 'system' and use our ideas and creativity to oppose it, raising our consciousness to a level which enables us to surpass the system. We are currently living in an interesting era in which we are struggling to put our mapped solution to the climate crisis but it seems like we are all MIA (missing in action). Relating it back to vanguard,  I believe you are right about vanguards being historically corrupt as leaders of our society, most of the time they live long enough as heroes to see themselves as villains. Like I have said before throughout the course, it is easier for us to suggest solutions for society, if we can't even suggest a solution for our own habits. We are currently living in a world full of irony. We all need to have a self reflection within ourselves regarding this issue because not only our planet and human race is on the line, but also the other living beings. I feel like we are too distracted on issues around us that are not necessary that we often place our own identity and decision making to other people. Hence, these corrupt leaders that are living lavishly and foolishly playing with our minds with their charismatic approach to society. Bottom line, We need to make this solution happen, and obviously, it won't happen overnight, we need to constantly reflect on ourselves on how we are going to evaluate and act upon the climate crisis, and I believe that a good start will start by our own personal habits and lifestyles. We need to be REAL activists, REAL role models, REAL action takers, and most importantly, REAL people in addressing the issue of climate crisis.

I agree with you; we have to realize our own power  and the consequences of our decisions. Growing up meat was large staple in my family. I would at least have it once a day. I thought this was normal, why wouldn't I everyone around me was doing the same thing. It was not until a few years ago that this rate of meat consumption was new and did not always have an impact on my family. My grandparents and parents both come from Mexico and they were raised to eat mostly vegetables, grains, and some kind of legume. Meat was very expensive and during the time when my grandparents were young the opportunity to eat meat did not come very often. The chances that were granted all parts of the animal were used. There was no waste and the animal carried a purpose later on. It is insane to me that something I considered such a necessity in my lifestyle was barely introduced in my family. 
<br><br>


I think we forget that availability plays a large role in our dietary habits. When we purchase things that accommodate our lifestyle we do not realize that every dollar spent acts like a vote. If we were to consider where our dollar was going and the causes our dollar would support there would be a shift in demand. This would allow a plant based diet to become more accessible to the public. This logic applies to everything.

<br><br>

Like Ken mentioned when he decided to no longer travel by plane he was faced with consequences that not only impacted him personally, but also professionally. If more educators were to decide to also participate in this lifestyle this would cause a chain reaction of events. Conferences would be more accepting of the  decision and more funding would be put into programs that would allow for this type of meeting to occur smoothly and reach a lot of people.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with your opinion that we should start to think what we can do to save our planet, and we need to change but not blindly following what others say. We have to change as soon as possible but in a right way, and we have to maintain our initial will to keep doing so. Not being changed after knowing the benefits of power. The very first step to make a revolution on climate crisis is to make everyone realize how important it is to save our planet, to realize the consequence, and spontaneously want to make changes inside them. We should start to think and list out all the things we can do to save climate and then try our best to accomplish that.



<br><hr>
The fact that you used a J Cole lyric makes your comment a thousand times better. But I agree with you if we want to see something done regarding the climate crisis then we need to start to act and start to take steps in reducing our carbon footprint. And you’re right it starts with the people we hang out with and the people we follow on social media. Social media can make a big difference in a good and bad way, and sometimes it is difficult to distinguish good information from bad information, because words and sources can get mixed up. And you’re right if more “influencers” promoted things such as vegetarianism or veganism rather than the latest shoe that Nike came out with, then I feel like our carbon footprint would start to go down. And yea it make seem unrealistic that people will start to become vegan because of one celebrity, but at the same time its possible many people look up to stars and want to be like them so bad, so you never know, because frankly all it takes it just one person to start that trend and then boom everyone has hopped on.

I totally agree that too much influence and power can make a person greedy and self-interested. The system seems to just be a cycle of the same selfish leaders taking power, but I feel like if it was more focused on the well-being of each individual rather than an almighty figure, we could make more progress. I never really thought of it that way, but we should start small and focus on changing our own practices and those around us rather than trying to act like a hero in the climate crisis. I feel like all the big influencers should be educated and more aware about climate change, so they know better about what to promote.

I think you raise an important point in regards to how we should approach the issue of trying to change other’s minds. I think it's important to not go about it in an egotistical and/or selfish way. The best thing we can do is obviously make the changes on a personal level first, and then try to persuade others in a way that doesn’t make it about how what we’re doing is right and what they’re doing is wrong. It might be true that that’s the case, but people often get defensive if not defiant when you accuse them of doing something wrong. Instead I think we should approach it from a place of educating people about the facts first, then followed by a moral stance on how we each have a responsibility to each other and the planet. I think if we approach it from this angle we can help “convert” many more people who at the moment, don’t consider this a realistic option. I’d think it’s likely many don’t consider their diet essential to helping climate change, but by spreading awareness and sharing the facts in a calm manner, I think we can slowly help make a much needed and positive difference towards each other and the world at large.

I definitely agree that we cannot wait until everyone is ready to fix the environment and plead to our politicians. We need to stand up and begin now. Completing the 5 steps Ken mentioned in an earlier lecture is a great step. We need to be role models and show our close family and friends that we are able to change the world for the better and that it isn’t as hard as everyone makes it out to be. When I think about role models online who preach veganism and sustainable clothing and food, I feel like many of them are taking a wrong approach to this. They might be sustainable in one way but completely oblivious to another practice they do that is very bad for the environment (like flying or driving an expensive car). This is not smart and quite frankly very dangerous because the people who look up to them see them as such sustainable people who they should follow in every way (including flying and buying expensive cars). As Ken mentioned as well, I think it is very important for us to make a change through speaking up and stating how we feel to local, state, and federal politicians because that is the only real way change can happen on a national or international level. Obviously it is great to see that people worldwide are taking steps to make their own lives more sustainable and better for the environment, but without the help of our politicians we can’t make big enough changes that will last and truly help our earth. 
<br><br>


For example, the carbon tax is an essential part of making the world less committed to finding “easy energy sources” and more committed to finding sustainable and renewable energy sources. The carbon tax is being used in both the Netherlands and Norway which are two countries leading in the fight against climate change. Although we as a country emit an extreme amount of greenhouse gases (both on our soil and by placing factories on other countries for our own benefit), we still don’t use a carbon tax to force corporations to limit their use of fossil fuels. This makes it extremely profitable for these companies to extract fossil fuels but if we stand up and ask our politicians to fight for a carbon tax, this could all change. We need to make these necessary changes NOW rather than wait for everyone else to get on board before it is too late.

I strongly agree with your comment in terms of how we should go about having a climate vanguard. I believe that the best way to hold others accountable is by holding yourself accountable. When everybody can approach the climate crisis from a personal standpoint then we would be able to make changes. This means no more hypocritical influencers which preach one thing and practice another. We cannot simply choose between what we should do that's good for the environment and bad for the environment in terms of our comfortability. If we support clean energy yet still drive everywhere we go then the only change we are really making is an imaginary one. Change will occur when we as a society decide to step out of our own comfort zone and contribute equally to the protection of our world rather then its decimation. Our society will decide whether the earth is worth saving in the coming years. We only have two options, either continue on the path we are on without anr regards of what the future might hold or change the way we live so that our children and their children can inherit an earth where the climate crisis is relic of the past.



<br><hr>
I agree with your points and interpretation of the quote in relation to being a vanguard in the issue of the climate crisis. The only way that we can really address the climate crisis is definitely by first changing something within all of ourselves. The influencers that post about plant based diets, but also post themselves wearing many different expensive things are only trying to show off. They are not really trying to address the climate crisis by changing all the most necessary bad habits. So, in order to fully utilize social media to spread environmental awareness and promote change, we need people that are selflessly driven. I like your point on being really thorough in our plan to change. I think making a list of all the things that we can do and setting goals on things that we can change, will bring great results. Once we have reached a certain point where we are successfully decreasing our negative impact on the environment, we can start to positively influence those in our circle and around us to try to do the same.



<br><hr>
Your reply is meaningful and remindful to the topic of being a climate vanguard and I agree with you that we should immediately change but have to do it in the right way. This means that we should consider the planet with respect to environmental-friendly changes and place the saving of the planet as our priority rather than our own benefits. Otherwise, all the undertaking is worthless and could result in bigger issues. It is also important to keep in mind that we should reconsider our relationship with all the things around us both culturally and distinctively as Ken says in this video. Things are always easy to say than done so it becomes absolutely necessary to reshape our thinkings and beliefs before we start to act. As long as we hold on to the belief of saving the planet, we will then be subject to change in a more easier way. Also, a lot of the climate-related issues start with our notion about the world which makes it more important to us that we should change the previous notion. Insisting on making changes from the bottom of our hearts and being cautious at every step, we are going to make a huge change as a new generation.

After seeing this quote from J. Cole, I couldn't agree more with the message of it. It is up to us to make a personal choice that will constitute change. If we just “wait” for everyone to get on board, we will be doomed because not everyone is going to want to make the change. However, as bold people come forward and be leaders through their actions, others will follow suit and promptly make the switch to becoming more environmentally conscious. I think what Denmark is doing with the climate labels is ingenious. Not only is it simple, but it’s such a small change to current systems that it will be easily integrated into mass culture. It will become as easy to check a product's environmental impact as it is to check what ingredients go into the product; it’s through small changes like this that will help make an impact culturally and systemically to the point where checking a product's environmental impact will become the norm for every family.

Lead by example. It's what I've been told countless times by my parents, my teachers, and my coaches. In this case as well, by being apart of the vanguard, we need to practice what we preach. I agree with you on the point that we need to. genuinely believe and practice that which we are advocating to society as a whole. If you look at the incidence of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, an ideology was weaponized to disparage millions of people and those who were at the top enjoyed lives of luxury that the common people were denied under the pretense of equality. In the same sense, if we want people to believe in environmental causes, we cannot be hypocritical. To build upon your comment on social media as a double edged sword, another thing to consider is the fact that on social media, people only post about good aspects of their lives, not the negative ones. People don't like to confront reality on social media so it becomes important to advocate environmentally favorable practices in a way that doesn't sound alarmist. At the end of the day, convincing the public will be able establishing ethos and using the right pathos.



<br><hr>
I find your view of becoming a vanguard very intriguing and even inspiring. I believe that the “revolution” should start within us, considering it's going to be hard to make the entire world change their beliefs when we, ourselves, still live like true consumerists. In order to make others address the error of their current ways, we should be promoting healthy, clean living, such as moving to a plant-based diet, only consuming what is necessary, and traveling in an environmentally friendly way. If everyone were to start living this type of lifestyle, it would become a trend, at least among the younger generations, which would work to help reduce global carbon emissions. 
<br><br>


Fads have not always been seen as a good thing, but certain ones, such as the current thrifting fad, have led to great advances for the environment. If our current generation were to use our platforms to promote smaller carbon footprints, I believe we would have succeeded in our goals to become true climate vanguards.



<br><hr>
I agree with you that our generation can successfully change the system, but there is a very real possibility that we end up doing the exact same the previous system did. I feel like that translates into the importance of tackling the climate crisis at its very roots at a systematic, cultural level. I always say that it's vital that we create systematic change, but at the same we need cultural change too. We need to rethink how and what we consume and the implications of mass consumerism in order to do better. This means that individual changes are pretty important too. I also feel like taking a more individualistic approach to solutions might make it more enticing for those who had not felt inspired to take action to do so. Through individual changes we get to feel as if our contribution is more tangible and more meaningful. This is especially of importance, as you mentioned, in people who are in spheres of influence. It's counterintuitive to be posting about a plant-based diet but then show off all the high-end brand clothing they have. Overall, I think both systematic and cultural change are incredibly important in combatting the climate crisis at its roots--rather than just from a technological approach where we all stay stuck in our ways.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. In order to become the vanguard in the issue of the climate crisis, we should start with ourselves and act now. In today's society, being a vanguard is really hard because there are many people working against us for their own benefits. The Kardashian family is a great example. Almost every member of the family has billions of fans in social medias. Both their posts and their documentaries shows luxury living, which influences the values of audience negatively. However, this is just a small epitome of our sick society. In developed countries, materialism is swallowing people's minds and transform them into shopping machines. In developing countries, many people admire the lifestyles of developing countries and try to mimic them. In this situation, we are eager for the existence of vanguards, and they will bear great responsibility. Just like the butterfly effect, a person's power is small, but his behavior will cause more people to change. First, a city changes; second, a nation changes; at last, the world changes.



<br><hr>
What Yoyo said greatly resonated with me. I think that part of why I've been feeling so helpless in all this is that so much of the fight against climate change has to rest with politicians making big changes and at the end of the day I have no trust for politicians. I feel that even if they happen to be fighting with a cause I agree with, that their standpoint will change the minute their position or financial backing is challenged. I also think that with monetary manipulation and threats to people's physical safety by leaders of influential corporations, that next to no one will have the will or even ability to get into a position to, and actually implement change. Therefore, I agree with you largely that the best thing we can do is start with ourselves. Even this can be quite a difficult fight though, which is why I really liked your suggested approach of making a list and starting with things we know we can do.



<br><hr>
I love the way you begin your comment with the J.Cole quote, especially "The only real revolution happens right inside of you," because this is sooooooo applicable for the climate crisis. Being students in Ken's class, the Climate Crisis, we are so fortunate and privileged to have all of this information about the climate crisis that most people in the world do not know or understand. First, we have to make the change in ourselves individually to bring about the change necessary to solve the climate crisis. We are the vanguards of the climate crisis, we are the future, and as Ken paradoxically states, the future is now. In order for these changes to come, we are responsible for being the change. Like Ken does himself, creating the telecommunication software for teachers, we need to forge the path forward, because this is the path humanity will inevitably need to take, and the sooner the better. 
<br><br>
For me, eating vegan is definitely a way to bring about that change. It is weird to come home from college telling my family that I am vegan, when virtually every lunch and dinner has meat involved. And although the food is really good, I am sticking to being vegan to show them how I find it important and to be an example. We are the future, and the change must start within.



<br><hr>
I believe we are in need of climate vanguards. We can't just talk about the problems, we need to start living lifestyles that mitigate the problem. However, it's very easy to become upset at those that are hesitate to change their ways. For this reason, I completely agree with your comment in how we need to make sure that we don't let ego get in the way of our cause. We need to constantly be aware and make sure that we are acting for the good of the environment and not our own selfish motives. I truly believing that living as an example is the best way to inspire others! So let's be climate vanguards, live an environmentally friendly lifestyle, and inspire others to do the same!



<br><hr>
I agree with your viewpoint on this issue of whether a vanguard is needed. I feel as though waiting usually never makes the results any better and if anything, may cause the state of the problem to become worse. I think that change should begin now as it is something that will be needed to be done now or later. And if we can begin tackling it now, there shouldn't be any reason not to do so. I think there needs to be deep consideration in the manner in which it will be done, as you have stated. I think while the beginning intention is clear and without any ulterior motives, it is an opportunity for it to grow into something that can change into something for the worse, and deter away from the original motivations behind it. I don't think we can afford the time in which waiting for everyone to get on board, we have already been doing that for way too long. I think now is better than later and we owe it to the planet on which so much life inhabits it, and for the future as well.

I always feel sorry about this topic because wasting food is kind of normal for me. When I eat in the dining hall in the university, I always get a plate that full of food that I am not even sure I can finish them all. Also, not only me but also many other people do the same thing like me. Due to these large amounts of food waste, American produces tons of waste per day which are definitely dangerous to our environment. In this way, I think it would be necessary to come up with ideas to solve food waste problem. From my perspective, I think it would be feasible to limit the food that people purchase either from supermarkets or restaurant, so people will not buy a bunch of food that will be wasted at the end. Moreover, in the university dining hall, university should set up rules to ask students finish all the things in their plates or they will be punished in different ways.



<br><hr>
I really appreciated your J. Cole quote and its application to this lecture’s issue. I couldn’t agree more with your point that we need to implement change within our own lifestyle, behaviors, and surrounding culture before we go about preaching in pursuit of convincing others to change themselves. You directly followed up for the first statement in saying that vanguards usually fall into the similar patterns and practices to that of the system they wanted to overthrow and revolutionize. I think this is most important for our rising generation as climate leaders today. As mentioned above, the worst-case scenario for the situation is if we end up in the collective condition where we are pushing the issue into the hands of others without recognizing and applying it to ourselves. We certainly need to change, but we, more importantly, need to do it correctly if we want to see genuine, widespread, and lasting change. These issues need to become meaningful and personal to the individual before true change can be applied to the masses.



<br><hr>
I agree with you. Our power is limited. If we just propagandize the environment protection life style by personal conversation, public an article or so on, we can not affect a lot of people. Even our closest friend will change his/her lifestyle just because of our persuasion. We need to have more influence first and then we use the influence to change other people's life habits. 
<br><br>


For example, if we have money. We can pay people to eat healthy, :). We can build a subway or bus line and let people use it without charging them. We hire a lot of people to make a pyramid scheme like Amway to propagandize the other people. The same thing for politic power, we can become the head of some office and we can incline all the resources to protect our environment.



<br><hr>
I agree a movement begins with one person and we all need to start somewhere if we want to get somewhere. If people did they're small part in decreasing meat consumption and it catches such as social media and it was promoted by many I think it could really make a difference. People should each try to do their own part even if they can not join an organization for the climate crisis. As long as they do their part they are contributing to helping the climate crisis and saving our planet.



<br><hr>
I 100% agree with you. The climate crisis won’t be solved unless we have the genuine intention of changing the world for the better. It shouldn’t become some sort of competition.  I’ve noticed recently that some climate activists have become increasingly  aggressive with people who might not be educated on or exposed to the effects of the climate crisis. Despite the opportunity to inform those who aren’t informed, they choose to shame the individual instead of informing them the right way. I’m interested to hear Ken’s lecture on how to go about communicating/sharing knowledge on the climate crisis with others.  I think the only real way to solve this issue is as a collective- a global movement. As Ken mentioned in the lecture, little things can become big things. This same thought applies to doing our own individual parts. From choosing to make the switch to a plant based diet, deciding to limit/stop flying, or just doing everything we can in our own lives. Although it may seem like one person cant make a difference, remember that millions of people around the world are doing the same as you and millions more are watching you and maybe being inspired to join. Voting is something we can also do that plays a major role, especially these upcoming elections. We need to elect politicians who will listen to what the people want and at the same time, we have to make them hear us.



<br><hr>
That quote is really applicable. Coming from a small town to UCSB, I understand the struggle to make environmentally conscious decisions when you aren't given easy alternatives. In my hometown, everything is pretty spaced out and there isnt much to do. The only public transportation we have is a small fleet of buses that carry few people to a select few locations, making it difficult to utilize. Most people are forced to commute pretty far to work, and they have to drive, because anything else would take too long. 
<br><br>

It is interesting to me that my home county is also one of the most conservative in the state, and is represented by Tom McClintock as part of California's 4th Congressional District, one of the most conservative, anti-climate change legislators in congress right now. Our local political scene is much the same, and I feel like without more infrastructure we cannot lessen our environmental impact, but we cannot add infrastructure without elected officials. So basically those of us that want to make a change are forced to just do it on our own, whether through changing habits or through protesting, both of which are becoming increasingly common amongst the youth in the town.



<br><hr>
I think this is the approach everyone needs to take when thinking about the climate crisis. Quite literally any change you can personally make to decrease your carbon footprint is a great change that should be celebrated; obviously the bigger changes you can make the better they are, but anything helps. It's not an all or nothing scenario.



<br><hr>
Your comment is really convincing and inspiring for me. Act or wait is a forever debatable question that has appeared in Ken’s video for more than one time. It’s true that the real revolution only starts inside of myself. When I am sighing every time watching Ken’s video and feels no hope for the problem, I’m denying the revolution inside of me. I know I can’t wait anymore cause the situation is extremely urgent. While I know I shouldn’t take unnecessary travel by airplanes, I bought the ticket for New York for spring break. While I know I shouldn’t waste food, I can’t continue chewing when the food is unsavory and eventually waste them. While I know the astonishing pollutant emission by the fast fashion industry, I can’t help myself buying cute clothes today. For me, I have a long way to go.



<br><hr>
I agree with you, we need to start acting now.  We need to act before it is too late to do anything.  With all the air travel that takes place, and along with all the other huge factors that play into the climate crisis.  It is only a matter of time before it is too late to act.  It has been highly recommended time after time that we should switch over to a plant based diet.  This is because the consumption of meat is a huge factor of the emission of greenhouse gases.  Speaking for myself, I know that I would have a very hard time switching over to just a plant based diet.  Not only switching our diets but also cutting off air travel.  Air travel is a major factor for the release of CO2 into the atmosphere.  If we were somehow able to cut off air travel, then it would be a huge step forward.  But I know in order for that to happen there would have to be some sort of major rise in prices.  Too many people love traveling through the air, because one it is convenient, and much quicker.  The problem is  air travel produces tons of greenhouse emissions.  Ken stated something very interesting, and that was a "carbon tax."  This sounded like a very good idea because it would increase prices on many things.  For one it would eventually increase the prices on air travel to the point where it would be too expensive.  And people would eventually completely cut off air travel for good.  If this were to happen everybody that travels through the air, their carbon foot print would decrease significantly.



<br><hr>
I see that it's important to find in ourselves to do the right thing and use everything in our own power to improve our world. But, I still see that there are other individuals in the world that already hold so much power that it would greatly overtake our own actions. I'm thinking about the rich companies that could easily lobby or create campaigns to influence in the other direction. This causes so many other individuals to be deceived against their own knowledge, and it makes it so much harder to try to shift the culture to combat the climate crisis. Even if we change our behavior ourselves, it doesn't guarantee the solution we are trying to go for.



<br><hr>
I completely agree. We, as a culture, need to start understanding what is and is not important. We can get caught up in healthcare issues and social justice problems for hundreds of years but in the end the climate crisis is what is going to define our generation as well. We can no longer rely on a small group of people to lead the way and make the decisions that will be best for all of us. We have failed for the past several decades so now the hard choices must be taken into our own hands.



<br><hr>
I think that this is such a great video because it talks about the importance of the carbon tax and cultural change. The fossil fuels are most important to tax because airplanes are extremely bad for the environment. Ken again is suggesting that we stop traveling as he stopped traveling a year ago. I like the suggestion of the neutral conference models as it is a way for everyone to talk without having to spend money on airplane and having the environmental effects. 
<br><br>


I think that we should as a country waste less food and eat non meat diets. In history meat rich diet was seen as affluent and that is why everyone swears by eating meat. I also wonder what the diet of the future will be like, as I wonder if we will actually only have vegetable protein for meat. I think it is also interesting that we only eat the roots of the beats when everyone can eat the leaves. We also need to stop importing foods and make cultural changes.




<br><hr>
It’s interesting to me that America is so divided on the issue of the climate crisis and that a large part of that division stems from corporations unwilling to look beyond financial profits and individuals unwilling to sacrifice certain aspects of their lifestyle which is understandable because thought we might like to pretend otherwise, peer pressure is a powerful thing and if there’s no peer pressure, habits are even harder to break. 

<br><br>

I say it’s interesting that America is divided on the climate crisis because before I immigrated to America and made this country my home, I lived in Canada where I was exposed to the following quote: “Culturally, there may not be much difference between America and Canada. But if there was one key distinction it’s this. Americans aren’t afraid to rally together and go against the status quo. Americans aren’t afraid of change, of innovation, of new ideas. Americans dream big. Canadians… well, we’re just nice.”   

<br><br>

I think it's long overdue for Americans to rally together and become a model that the rest of the world can look to and follow when it comes to addressing the climate crisis. Since when did America become a country that was afraid of change, unwilling to defy the status quo? After all, if America can’t do it, then who can? And yet, more and more the narrative in other countries seems to be shifting to: “If we can do it, why won’t America?”



<br><hr>
First of all, I love the quote you used to start your argument and further develop it. I have always been a firm believer that if you want to change something in the world, you have to change yourself first to show others that it is possible for them too. As Greta Thunberg once said, "Either we do that or we don't." What I get from the quote is that either we are all work together as one or we don't. Our generation needs to be the vanguard of the future and no, we cannot sit around and wait for everyone to start acting out. For example, take the civil rights movement. People did no wait for everyone to start rebelling against their oppressors. Brave and smart people had to step up and sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Many were not able to see a new dawn, but that did not stop the rest from taking further action. We should take these kinds of movement as an example and follow their footsteps. Usually, we are architects of our own future, but at this point, we all have to be architects of a greater and better future. We should focus more in shaping our children's future, so they can live better lives.
<br><br>

On this week's segment, Ken talked about the importance of wasting less food and introducing a plant-based diet in our lives. As many have already noticed, this does not require a technological change, but rather a cultural change. These two things combined could reduce greenhouse emissions far more than the other 75 points on the project drawdown list, and it only requires small sacrifices from ourselves to do so. I know it's not simple. My family has introduced me to a diet full of meats. It is hard for me to change to a plant-based diet but not impossible. Recently, I have been introducing more salads to all my foods and reducing the amount of meat I eat. I know I am not taking a radical change, but I believe that little by little, I will substitute meat for other healthier stuff. We should all re-think what we eat and how we eat it. Many people eat beef as if it was water, meaning that they eat it so often that it becomes essential for them to have at least a piece of meat on their tables. Furthermore as Ken noticed, not all issues can be solved by individuals as we need the help form politicians to also be committed to climate change. If they can't commit, we would only get so far. Therefore, we should vote for people who really represent the best interest to fight climate change. Let's be heard, clear and loud and become climate vanguards.




<br><hr>
I definitely agree. Historically, vanguards of various movements either become corrupt or greedy, or get targeted and even killed. I think it's better that we don't have a specific vanguard or leader because it prevents any of that from occurring. If we change our own practices, as well as focus on our sphere of influence and how we can encourage others do adopt more environmentally safe practices, then we can really make more of a difference than a vanguard would make. The misinformation and lack of awareness surrounding such a detrimental issue is scary, and we must do what we can with what we know to change that.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with you that social media has a huge impact. Being a vanguard alone might not be influential but if we can convert more people in doing the right thing together we can definitely change the game. I have friends switching to a vegan diet due to environmental and ethical causes. Right now 3% of the people in the US are vegan. This might not be a large number, but they are making eating vegetables to look cool. It has been proved that a vegan diet is related to significant weight loss. Many people looking for body transformation also try to eat more veggies. We can easily convince ourselves after taking Ken’s Climate Crisis 101 but how are we gonna influence the general public who do know tons about global warming? Social media is definitely a great choice to get things trendy. For a celeb, all it takes is just a few clicks and the crowd will explode. To the public, celebrities might be even more influential than the actual environmentalists and scientists. That does not only make them more powerful in conveying the good ideas but also make them more dangerous in transmitting incorrect thoughts. They should really be aware of what they say about global warming.



<br><hr>
I really like the quotes that if we do not want to make changes from our deep heart, we will never change. No matter how easy the solutions are, we can always find excuses. If we really want to make changes and improve, no matter how hard it is, we can always find solutions. It is about the world, it is true that we as an individual, our power is small, but this does not mean we should not act and do it. Being small doesn't mean do not do it at all. It is still hard for us to make changes for the world, but we can change our own habits first, then you family, then your close friends and they will do the same things. It is the little circle that we get more and more people changed and improved, but it all starts at the first little step by yourself. It is like the all the forests were all began by a little seed. Ken's example of using skype is perfect that sometimes little things can change a lot . A video from thousand miles away can save a flight ticket which is a large CO2 releases. I also agree with you that there is no time to wait. We do not want to be the first because it might feel awkward, but doing good things should not be awkward, instead it should be honored. Act now by yourself is a good solution.



<br><hr>
While I agree that aiming to overthrow the system in order to combat the climate crisis seems like an extreme and dangerous goal when we are capable of controlling our own output and impact on the climate, I have to play devil's advocate here. While it is true that in an ideal world the spread of information and the truth would intrinsically motivate everyone to do the right thing without the need of outside motivation by means of regulation or government, the real world is filled with people who are wholly unwilling to listen to reason or the truth, and misinformation is much more malicious than we can predict. This is a problem because combating the issue of climate change necessitates a near universal response, not even a majority response. Even if a large majority of the people on the planet are intrinsically motivated to watch their emissions (highly unlikely due to current misinformation and moral laziness), if the minority refuses to act that still ruins the climate for the rest of the population. For this level of unanimity of action, regulations MUST be used in order to combat laziness and misinformation.

I too believe that we need to change our practices and influence around us in order for us to commit to a largely plant based diet, but in doing so we will have a positive impact on the world.  Seeing how culture affects it was something interesting to see and the irony behind it. The fact that our cultures may have been corrupting our original heritage and that changing our diet could be beneficial to our heritage is something amazing to see. To think that moving places would alter our inner heritage and form something new is crazy to see and the irony is strong. This may prove hard because those in our families may believe that we are practicing treason because we are not sticking to the "tradition". Even with the beef industry, we are still eating so much yet in turn we are also wasting so much so we need to cut back on industries that stir up more emissions and focus on what we can do as humans in order to reduce our footprint.

I appreciate the quote that you included in your comment. I agree that we should change ourselves and our own actions first before we try anything bigger. It is the little actions that we do on a day-to-day basis that accumulates. Therefore, we should all strive to make better decisions overall. It is comforting to know that there are simple things that I can personally do to help the environment, especially since I feel helpless amidst the political and economic side of this situation. I also agree with how social media will help spread awareness regarding this issue and solutions that will help combat it. However, we must also practice what we preach if we were to promote ideas to combat the issue for this to actually help make a change.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with you that people in our generation need to make the change now. The influence of social media is powerful, so that we need to use it in the right way. It is our responsibility to make a difference and fix the problems of the climate crisis. Some people may think that every thing done by a single person is negligible, but collectively it will make a change. Also, I really love the last sentence in your comment, “…include one thing that is not, then try and accomplish that.”



<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your statement that we should try to accomplish things within our own power. Often times, I’ve heard a lot of my friends say that they won’t or “can’t” make changes to their lifestyle because it’s not within their capabilities. Or that they feel that even if they do make a change that it won’t matter because not everyone else is guaranteed to make the same changes. In a way they see it as why should they give up certain aspects of their lifestyles if someone else isn’t going to give up that same thing. However, like you said, it’s important to do what we can within our capabilities because small changes like that contribute to the bigger picture and will add up. It’s obvious that many of us don’t have a million followers to spread the word of climate change to, but we do have friends and family that we can tell. If everyone just started off by letting their friends and family become aware it would help increase the amount of change people are contributing. Sometimes, not all the times, this is the most effective method because you’re more likely to care and hear someone out when it’s a person you have a close relationship to. 
<br><br>

This idea applies to the food thing too. Not everyone needs to go vegan or vegetarian, but people just need to realize that cutting back on meat, especially beef, can have a significant impact in itself. I feel that sometimes there’s this misconception that people have to give up meat or animal products all together to make a change. However, like Ken said just lowering your meat intake and not wasting a lot of food can have a significant impact.



<br><hr>
Yes. Although personal strength is small, we can change the people around us. At the same time, money must not be allowed to affect our beliefs. We live in the age of the Internet, and countless information is disturbing us. But we can also use the Internet to promote our views and make more people aware of the crisis brought about by climate change. We should also be cautious. We should not just call on people to do things. We must list relevant evidence and give measures that have less impact on social stability.

I was similar to you coming from a strict household that required us to always always finish what was on our plate and at home and eating out. I was taught early on in the form of a chinese song that every grain of rice took time to grow and get harvested so that we should eat and appreciate every single grain. And even within the next generation of people who can be unified about climate change there are many who waste food which will continue to keep the demand for food production extraorbantly high. I have read a article stating how an ideal view of what a supermarket should look like requires new food almost everyday to keep all the shelves stocked. This obviously is not sustainable for the produce department where fruits and vegetables go bad faster than many other foods but because no one will buy them when there are just a couple, the shelf has to always be full of fruits and veggies which leads to waste even before food goes home to a household. Practices like these need to be changed and a new culture of non waste needs to be established to help the environment.

I like how you phrased this response. I think it's powerful to take a step back and ask yourself what is a realistic change you can make and then move forward by taking the necessary steps to accomplish that. Then you can help others around you to do the same. I have often thought about this and felt as though I need to make these monumental changes and start impacting people on a large scale, but what about those around me? How can I help them make these changes as well and start the domino effect? Powerful way to approach this. It also reminds me of one of the initial lectures Ken did when he said we cannot wait for those who are responsible to take action because they aren't going to and ultimately it is our future at stake. I think it's easy to become overwhelmed with this crisis and trying to figure out your place in coming up with solutions. People fall into the trap of thinking individual efforts don't matter, but they do. All it takes is one person to initiate a change in another and then that person can initiate a change in another and so on. This small steps can have significant impacts.

Something that I have started doing is holding dinner parties where I cook plant-based meals with my friends. I have cut out meat and eat a largely plant-based diet so having these dinners with my friends that have not made the switch sort of introduces them to it in a simple and social way. To me, I hope to show it is possible to have good meals if meat is not involved, especially now with the availability of alternatives to animal-based products. Ken mentioned how switching to a largely plant-based diet isn't as attractive, but I think it could at least be a little more attractive if we figure out how to take a creative approach to it and other solutions.

The concept of a vanguard falling victim to a "double-edged" sword is unfortunately so applicable to our modern society. People on Youtube will pretend as if they're helping homeless people and provoke others to act similarly. However, you then start to realize that all the videos are scripted and the person is just posting videos for exposure. I don't mind if vanguards act in self-interest, and as a by-product, promote something helpful; however, I know this isn't always the case. 
<br><br>
Your point almost reminds me of the Cowspiracy documentary that was assigned for this week. In it, companies that are supposedly "Environmentalist" avoided talking about the livestock industry in the fear that they'd lose exposure. I think they all started with similarly good intentions, but were eventually overcome with a greedy corporate mindset. This is why, as the forthcoming pioneers, we should be extremely wary of our actions and the consequences that can potentially follow.

When people talk about Climate crisis in general, it sounds like a vague yet huge problem that everyone is aware of yet don’t know how to start tackling it. When we narrow what we can do about it down to its quintessences, it is as simple as three words -- start acting now. The urgency of the issue is definitely not a strange guest to us at this point of the class. However, not everyone has the courage and dedication to act upon it. I remember a quote from my favorite TV show Altered Carbon that says “the anger against injustice is universal, but the courage to take action is not”. I find this drawing some parallelism towards the issue of climate change, especially those who are well aware of the potential disaster Climate change can bring upon us. Yes, it is a big commitment and it would definitely cut off some aspects of our personal pleasure. I had never been a vegetarian or vegan for my whole life, and as an out of state student, travelling, especially by air, is a big part of my life too. I think a good way for me to start reducing our carbon footprint, as applicable for others in my shoes too, is to start trying a vegetarian diet once or twice a week to try it out. I am glad that from day to day School dining comms offer whole-cafeteria vegetarian options, as it would be more friendly to both vegetarians and the environment. Even tho, food waste can be quite an issue. I have seen people quite frequently bring their whole untouched food to return as its quite upsetting, as I believe this is quite an issue with an all-you-can-eat cafe. I believe this would be a good aspect for UCSB to start addressing next to trying to reach 0-carbon emission.

To simply answer the question, “do we need a climate vanguard?” I say yes. In response to Yoyo’s comment I agree. We do need to be Vanguards of the future, and we need to do it today. Yoyo’s J. Cole quote even though not explicitly relevant is very true. We need to change our behaviors and the way we go about being Vanguards before we actually become vanguards. Ken mentioned that shared practices essentially shift cultures a lot faster and a lot more constructively. I think that’s essential. Otherwise there is no other way this drastic needed change would work. That is why I say we need to all become Vanguard’s. Typically Vanguard’s or any type of leader can make change with almost zero initial support, although in the climate change crisis…we simply need everyone to make an effort. I personally believe we all just need to look at ourselves first, just as YoYo stated, it starts from within. At the very least we need to be active politically. If we can vote to let those in power make a change, I think it will be increasingly easier for everyone to make a cultural shift and potentially move towards a plant based diet.



<br><hr>
I really like your comment and agree with you that each person has to take responsibility in their everyday lives to make changes in their lifestyle.  I think you're right that many people might start with a good intention but can easily be persuaded by personal gain.  I think that in today's society, consumerism is highly praised.  Materialistic items have become so important in our society and until we can force ourselves to detach ourselves from this bad habit can we truly begin to make a great impact for the good of our planet.



<br><hr>
I agree with you on how we need to intrinsically change our practices and behavior when regarding climate change. This is a very bold statement though because it is a call to action and it is a call to action to change our ways of life and our entire system of doing things. I don’t think this is a bad thing though! I think everything we have learned to make the world a more environmentally friendly place are great ideas. A lot of the solutions not only help the environment but help human rights and human happiness as well. These solutions hold a wide range of benefits and it seems as though the world should have already thought of them! It is frustrating because environmental issues are so widespread and all encompassing that it makes it difficult to make large scale changes. As you said though, influencers or famous people can make more of an impact that they realize. Influencers and famous people have the ability to change culture through social media which is a huge platform to create environmental awareness and change. It is important that we use the resources we have and are comfortable with in positive ways.



<br><hr>

I agree that we should be taking steps in our own lives to make these changes happen, however, I also think we do need a climate vanguard because I believe people won't really see an issue with their ways of life until someone that is respected and validated by others says so. However, our individual changes are essential to this change as well because if we are going to make meaningful change, we need to do as much as we can to work towards the future of more sustainable living. This climate vanguard needs to be very careful in how they present themselves and the ways of life that are better because in our country we go after the things that are desirable.
<br><br>

This movement must ensure that it doesn't take an attack approach because people will not take that very well and will contribute to the invalidity of the climate crisis. The fact that going completely vegan or vegetarian isn't always the best choice was surprising to me because of how vegetables and fruits must be flown in from other countries at certain times of the year. A good option would be to ensure your food is locally grown and while we don't necessarily have to eliminate all animal products right away, greatly reducing it to make the transition to a plant-based diet is essential to comfortably transition into the future of diet.


<br><hr>

I agree, simply starting a small behavior with some friends and turning it into a large trend goes a long way in this day and age. If we start making change and perhaps start like a vegan pact with a group of friends and that slowly spreading to friends of friends causing a large impact. Even if some don't take up the pact of eating a plant-based diet they will at least become familiar with the idea and will understand the impact they are having when consuming certain foods and how a diet can relate directly to climate change. Getting out the message of overall being environmentally conscious and changing behaviors to be more eco-friendly is incredibly important as it will persuade some into taking action and actually reducing their carbon footprint, but also sparking conversation on the topic. I doubt most people even understand the impact consuming meet regularly has on the environment and making people aware is the first step in converting them to being environmentally conscious and will immediately make them more aware of their regular routines and how it is directly the economy and can take small steps to reduce their carbon footprint.

<br><br>

With the power of technology these days it is important we use it to our advantage and to utilize social media to educate and influence others into living greener lives as some of these lifestyle changes also benefit personal health along with the climate.




<br><hr>


I feel inspired by your quote and I also agree with your opinion that the revolution begins with changes of our own actions. Some people may believe that individual actions are too minimal and barely see the significance of doing it, but many great things start with small things, and when small things aggregate, they can be powerful. 
 <br><br>

To answer Ken’s question, I believe we should be climate vanguards, or at least people who care about the environment and other people in the world and actually do things to care about them. Ken stressed in his video about how changing our diets can make a real difference in helping with our environment. Just like how Jonathan Safran Foer named his book: saving the planet begins at breakfast, if each of us can make a small difference, that can accumulate into a significant change. Similarly, if everyone is waiting for the other to start to enact changes, then this basically means that nobody is making changes now, which probably also means that everyone on the planet is waiting for more climate disasters. I think that changes are definitely needed now, and I also think that different kinds of changes can be taken by different people. As a student, I can make changes by adjusting my personal lifestyle and supporting groups fighting climate change, and when I gained more knowledge and skills, I might be responsible for some important organizations so that a change of a bigger impact would potentially be enacted. 
 <br><br>

Lastly, I also want to note how Ken rather critically and objectively look at the change of eating largely plant-based diets. Ken not only pointed out that “diets that only included animal products for one meal per day were less GHG-intensive than lacto-ovo vegetarian diets.”, but also mentioned the travel cost involved in some vegan diets, which allow us to have a critical view of going vegan and other similar personal actions for the environment, helping us to make the most suitable and effective changes.



<br><hr>

I completely agree with you. I also believe that the first step we should take is to promote the ideas of living sustainably to the people around us, and in this process, we should be clear and straightforward with our goals and thoughts (such as shifting diet to consume less meat, avoid tv commercials, etc.) It doesn’t change much when there’s only one person taking action, even if they changed their lifestyle completely. But when there are many of us aware of our current situation and begin taking small steps forward, it could become a huge step and will become larger as time progress.




<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you say about social media being a huge influence on this generation. It is much easier to voice ourselves to others and our community about how we must change the way we live our lives in order to change the world we live in. I liked bow you pointed out that although social media can benefit us in producing positive change, it can also spread negatives things as well. Many might see their favorite influencer promoting fast fashion and want to copy them by shopping and purchasing products from fast fashion stores such as H&M and Forever 21.





<br><hr>

I completely agree with your point here. I thought about the way you structured your comment as metaphor for how we take on our role as climate vangaurd- using a popular verse or quote that mostly everybody can relate to and then using that clout to generate a discussion or even cause a trend. I feel like the masses nowadays is in this bandwagon trend where a lot of our wants and dislikes is mostly shaped by what mass media collectively agrees on. There are different niche's people can choose from depending on what's out there. My point is, if we generate enough positive clout promoting plant-based food diet, normalizing it and presenting it as cool (as opposed to healthy) to the younger generations, we can efficiently use the technological tools we have to revolutionize the diets corrupted by American consumerism. When I read your comment, I was thinking about the tide pod challenge that trended awhile ago. Teens were daring each other to eat Tide pods for no reason just the clout. As climate vanguards, we should be creative and innovative. We can't be stuck-ups trying to instigate a war between meat lovers and plant-based diet advocates. We can't just force people to change their diet, that's a personal decision they have to make themselves. Basically, this is an inception mission, to plant an idea in people's head but make them feel like it was their idea and feel good about doing the right thing.




<br><hr>

I agree that we should make a change now. This generation should lead the next generation into a better world, but I'm not sure we can change the minds of the older generation, or even some of the minds of our generation. Most people do what they were raised to do, which means our only real chance is to raise the next generation better. We can waste time trying to convince the older generation to change their ways and possibly make some changes, but a more effective way to make the planet a better place is to teach the next generation the actual impact of climate change in the United States and what we can do to prevent a disaster. That's what Ken did, he taught the younger generation, and I'm sure it took him some time to convince his generation that he had more impact on those who were still learning than on those who believed they had been taught. The most effective way to ensure a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is to educate those who will suffer the consequences of the older generation so that they can make a difference. Of course, we also need to start these changes to get off to a good start and make it easier for the next generation.




<br><hr>
I agree with you that we not only need to change but also need to change the right way. Historically, we have seen many vanguards ends up being greedy as you said. It is important that we need to change correctly so that our effort won't be wiped out by ourselves. I also agree that we should start little and also include something not with our power and trying to accomplish. I know that our change is not immediate and will have limited impact for each changes. However, what is important is starting doing something as soon as possible.





<br><hr>

I agree with what you say about having social media at our disposal now. With technology and the internet now, we can lots of messages round and spread the word about the change. An influencer now can get any of their followers to do whatever they do. If they were to promote being vegan or recycling they would get many others do it as well. although it is true though that even though there is one influencer promoting change, there can be another one who promotes stuff that doesn't really help the planet such as fast fashion. this influencer could promote companies such as H&M and followers would flock to the store and support them. I would say social media would be better at spreading messages that help support change, many people can be bought out to support products that aren't good for the environment.




<br><hr>
What you said is quite reasonable. Many people will repeat the same mistakes after overthrowing their predecessors.It sounds silly, so we have to fundamentally change ourselves, start with the little things around us, and gradually influence others such as parents, children and friends.Use your own behavior to set an example for them. Use your own actions to motivate them and let them influence more people.If every one of us does that from now on, I believe the impact will be enormous.Let's work together for this goal.





<br><hr>
I don’t think this is the same as the political upheavals from the past. There is little to gain from being a climate vanguard besides bettering the world for future generations. There will be politicians that are elected for this purpose that don’t really believe in the movement, but this is a necessary evil in the path to making Earth livable. I agree that we should make a list of the things in our power that we can accomplish, but we should accomplish those things first before we attempt to do something outside of our ability. We have to start somewhere. It’s much easier to start with what we can do rather than attempt something that may even prove impossible which would dishearten the rest of our journey in fixing our climate.





<br><hr>


I really appreciated your use of a J. Cole lyric to make this point.  I think it's really important that huge social media influencers use their platform for positive causes and specifically to spread awareness about the climate crisis.  Seeing as most people who pay the most attention to social media are part of a younger generation, a younger generation that will be receiving the immediate effects of the climate crisis.  We need to educate the masses, make them aware of what is to come if we do not make major lifestyle changes ourselves and impress upon legislators to make major changes in government to remedy the inhabitability of our environment.

I was always raised to eat everything that's on my plate and to save food as leftovers. I always thought that's what everyone else did too. But when I ate at my friend's house for the first time in elementary school I noticed everyone left half of their food on their plate and just threw away the excess. Why would someone make so much food knowing they weren’t going to eat it all? Not only are these people wasting an enormous amount of money, but they are also making such a negative impact on the environment. When I was visiting my family in Europe I noticed the portion sizes at restaurants was less than half of what they are in America, and I was still full by the end of every meal. This makes so much more sense for restaurants because they can charge the same amount of money to serve less food, and no food gets wasted at the end of the meal. In addition to this, Europeans tend to be less overweight than Americans, and I have a feeling portion sizes might be contributing to this. 
 <br><br>
 One of the hardest things about eating sustainably at college is not creating food waste. Because of how UCSB’s dining halls are set up, a tremendous amount of food is wasted at the end of every single meal. I have a feeling they don't save the food for later. Even if I'm eating vegan, I’m still not eating sustainability because I’m paying for food that gets wasted. One-third of the food that we produce in America is wasted. The first step in solving our country’s food issues is to cut out all of the unnecessary waste. Then we can focus on moving towards largely plant-based diets and sustainable farming practices. As Ken mentioned, most people won’t start acting on climate change until they have to, therefore we need to “trick” people, in a sense, into living more sustainability. By this, I mean making sustainable practices easier and more popular than the other options. People tend to “follow the herd”, so if we lead the “heard” in the right direction for the environment, most people will follow.

 I too grew up in a house where we had to finish everything on our plate; we weren't even allowed to leave any left over for saving leftovers. Growing up, this caused a lot of anxiety within myself because even once I started living on my own, I realized I was forcing myself to eat everything on my plate no matter how sick or full I felt. I soon realized ... why am I even making so much food in the first place? Such a simple realization for some reason took me forever to realize. But once I did, I started putting thought into my food portions and also eating out less. I realize a lot of the time eating out at restaurants always left me leaving so much food behind because of the portions which left me feeling guilty. One way I counter food waste is to meal prep and make my own food so that I don't have to eat out or as you state, eat at the school dining halls.
<br><hr>
I grew up in a house that wasted a lot of food. It never really occurred to me what was going on in my household or that it wasnt normal until i moved out and then I quickly realized how much food waste and money was going down the drain. I try to only buy my groceries weekly so that nothing goes to waste and that I only buy what I need. 
<br><br>
On the flip side of this however, when I go home I practically beg my family to cook and buy in smaller portions. They get upset with me because I am “judging” them and don't respect that people do things differently. I do not believe that a lot of people make these decisions maliciously. They are simply not educated on the repercussions of their actions and are too stuck in their way of living to change. I think education of young adults is the best way to combat this so that young adults form lifestyle patterns with these repercussions in mind.

I think the issue of food waste also stems from our disposable economy; in the same style of fast fashion, where we buy cheap things and throw them away when they wear out (or when we no longer like them), we buy cheap food, often unhealthy and animal-based because of subsidies hiding the true cost of products, and throw out what we didn't like or didn't finish. It's a new idea in our culture; my grandmother is horrified if one of my siblings or I don't finish our food, and she saves every scrap she can. My mother just throws it out. A "slow food" and "small food" revolution, where we buy less, cook more, and eat everything, will definitely address the issue of American food waste.

 <br><br>

As for the UCSB dining commons, the amount of food waste is probably about what you'd expect. When I first started working at one, I was pretty upset at the end of one of my shifts because I had to throw out so much food: plates of cake, dinner rolls, several entire loaves of bread. There was no fault or flaw in the food; it was just the end of the meal and it was time to clean up. We "couldn't" save it or donate it because it had been "sitting out for too long". (Like three hours is too long for a loaf of bread?) Food generally isn't saved if it's been set out at all. While there are measures in place to reduce how much we throw out (we put out smaller pans near closing, we keep things in the walk-ins until needed, etc) there's still several full bins of perfectly good food that ends up being composted. At least we keep it out of the landfill. The funny thing is that UCSB's dining halls are considered leaders in sustainability when it comes to campus dining in the U.S. It makes me wonder how bad other campuses are if several hundred pounds of edible food wasted every day is considered "gold-star sustainable."

<br><hr>
Every kid is told they need to eat their vegetables and finish their plate if they want desert. Yet the adults themselves are willing to waste food. How can the morals we push upon our children get so lost when it comes to us. This hypocrisy almost knows no bounds and this is just one example of it. It could be that US culture dictates that we must fill our plates and eat it all (when we actually cannot), but I have a feeling there is something else at play. You mention that we need to trick people, but what if it was easier than that. What if we could just show them the truth. We currently are not doing that when it comes to food. We are trying our hardest with fossil fuels but that is not enough, the public needs to know what we are learning in this class and I believe that people would follow if they were just educated.

<br><hr>
Growing up in an Asian household, I was usually forced to eat until my plate was clean and then some. When I got here and ate at the dining commons for the first time, I too was astonished at the amount of food that would go to waste. I knew it was going to be composted, so it left me with some hope, but it surprised me that people pay all of this money for a meal plan that they don't even use. In the same fashion as our disposable economy, we think that everything can be quickly replaced- and now thanks to the globalization of recoverability in the developing world, it can. Food, in this case, holds the most weight in the sense of 'I'll always have something to eat'. We take this privilege for granted so often that we forget that there are people who don't have the same opportunities as us and we constantly send food down the drain everyday. 
<br><br>
I also agree how eating sustainability while on a meal plan (and college budget) is extremely hard due to it not being of your own choosing. Your statement, "I'm still not eating sustainbly because I'm paying for food that gets wasted" really caught my eye. I'm not going to act like I haven't finished meals at Ortega because I didn't like them, but it is more often than not that food gets wasted because people just don't care. We are the ones building our own future, so we can't complain about the repercussions when we are the ones causing it. By 'tricking' people as you said, such as making smaller portioned meals like Europe, it not only shows great economic gain, but is substantially better for the environment and our future.
<br><hr>
I was raised the same way too. Even now, that I am in college, I save the leftovers as I often find myself making excess food. I have had the same experience when visiting other friends' house and visiting Europe. I had a friend that visited the US from Europe and that is a comment that he made. He said, " your portions here in America are huge compared to ours". I agree that serving smaller portions would benefit us in not letting food go to waste. If we cut out all unnecessary food waste, as you mentioned, it would have a great impact on our environment. 
<br><br>
Reducing food waste and then focusing on changing our diet seems reasonable. It is hard to get everyone onboard and therefore like you mentioned, we should work on making sustainable practices easier and popular.
<br><hr>
I really relate to your story of growing up always either finishing your food, or saving the leftovers. Every time I go to a restaurant with my family, we always take home our leftovers. 
<br><br>

When I was young, I went to a very hippie sleep-away camp. Our meals were set up very similarly to the dining commons here at UCSB: one big ll-you-can eat meal for everyone in the camp. But I remember at the first meal, the counselors introduced us all to the “clean plate club.” Anyone could be in the clean plate club, as long as they finished all the food they took. This practice began just as a way to remind hungry young kids that they can always go back for seconds. I still think like this today, whether I’m buying food, grocery shopping, or making dinner. I always make less than I think because I can always get more. 
<br><br>

I bring this up because being part of the clean plate club at this little summer camp became a genuinely cool thing. Everyone tried really hard to make sure they didn’t waste any food. I think this is an example of how we can take steps to lead the next generations. If we can be climate vanguards and teach people from a young age that flying is bad, driving is bad, beef is bad, etc, I think we actually could make some progress.

My dad always says, "Your eyes are bigger than your stomach." I used to get annoyed with him when he said this but it is so true. I tend to fall into the habit of getting everything that is available to me in the dining commons but that is quite dangerous. We know what is available to us in America so we aren't afraid to take more than we can handle. Ever since I started taking this class, I have been listening to Ken's voice in the back of my mind and slowly (but surely) am changing the way I eat in the dining halls. I used to get anything I thought looked good but I have realized I really only eat half of what I get, because I either don't like the other  foods, I am full, or I really only had the appetite for a certain thing. I am a first year but I have been here long enough to predict what will taste good and what won't, so I really have no excuse. I am a vegetarian (perhaps going vegan) so when I see something that I know will be good I take it, but most of the time I don't end up eating it. I never realized just how detrimental that is for the environment. Weirdly, I came from a family where I had to eat everything on my plate, as well, but as I got older the pressure faded away. And I am still trying to figure out why. I wish it hadn't because I think I would know exactly how much food is good for me and that I can handle, instead of guessing. Now I have developed a system where I grab maybe a couple things and go sit down. If I want some more, I can always just go back for it. I hate the buffet setup of the dining commons but I am figuring out a system that is more sustainable. I hope my friends are being observant and catch on, too.

<br><hr>
your example of the dining commons really resonated with me. I completely agree with your point about the tremendous amount of food waste that is created daily. It gets even more frustrating when you consider that not only is the food left uneaten discarded but also the food that is unserved as well. Because of the laws and guidelines regarding food service and sanitary conditions, a large amount of food waste is created in each of the dining commons on campus. 
<br><br>
I think another important point that you brought up, that you are essentially paying for food that gets wasted. If you extend this to all “buffet style” restaurants, you are now gaining an even larger understanding of where food waste comes from. If you think about hotel buffets, dining commons, and other places where massive amounts of food are produced and offered, then the statistic of one-third of the food in America is wasted becomes much more realistic. By frequenting these establishments, the American population continues to support this massively wasteful system. We clearly need to change this model of dining because like I mentioned above, when people take food and don’t eat it, then it is wasted. And after the dining establishment closes, the leftover foods are often wasted as well. 
<br><br>
Like Ken has noted in many videos, the solution is just to produce less food. The problem is that no establishment wants to be in a situation when they lose out on profits because they have no food left to offer. This is yet another example in our current society where financial gain outweighs the environmental impact and change needs to be made in one form or another.

Yes. People are sheep and if one way of eating becomes popular or trendy they will switch to that. I think shaming people into eating all of their food or eating more plants isn't a bad idea. Besides, it benefits your own personal health to eat more plants, not just the planet. My parents would get upset at me if I threw food away and my fridge growing up was filled with tupperwares of random leftovers. We made use of most if not all the food we ate. 
<br><br>


Good point about the dining halls, too. They always throw a ton of food away at the end of the day. I wonder if they can do any analytical work concerning which foods to make more/less of, which mealtime to make less food for, etc. I'd imagine they have data on how many people swipe in for each meal. Maybe they could find a way to keep data on the most popular foods and least popular foods. They could set an amount of a certain food they are going to make, and if they run out that's too bad, there are many other options at the dining hall.
<br><hr>
I was raised the same way you were in that we ate what was given to us and we didn't waste food in our household. Seeing daily how much food is wasted daily at UCSB in DLG and yet their policies prohibit students from taking food outside perplexes me. I am told no when I try to sneak some food out such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to save for later. If I don't take and eat that sandwich I guarantee there will be a surplus of bread when the dining commons close at the end of the day. Once again, I understand they have policies, but when these policies are wasting food that doesn't have to be wasted it just doesn't make sense.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that we should make sustainable practices easier and more popular because then social media would be centered around that and influencers would try to mimic these ideals just so that they can have clout and still be relevant in today's society. I was not raised to eat everything on my plate, I just did because I love food. I feel that the biggest waste makers in my house were my sisters because they never finished their food and their leftovers would rot in the fridge unless I ate their food without their permission haha. Responding to your question about why people would make so much food and not finish it, well I feel that this is a problem because people get amazed at how much food options there are especially at buffets and they put as much food as they can on their plate just for the heck of it and because it looks appetizing. Something about having more and the phrase bigger is better are drilled into peoples minds and they do this unknowingly at that moment of time. That is why the supersize option was introduced in the U.S. because people had this ideology and that is most likely why the food sizes here were bigger than in Europe. Also replying to your comment on UCSB's dining common food, I feel that people waste food because most of the time the food is not even good. If we switch over to a more largely plant based diet then it's still going to be harmful for the environment if we are still uneducated about it. That should be our first step: to educate others about this and then we can reduce the amount of waste we are producing because even Ken said, " diets that only include animal products for one meal per day were less GHG intensive than some vegetation diets." Also electing officials that will hammer down what needs to be done to live a more sustainable life will also be a better first step.
<br><hr>
Growing up I also was taught to eat everything that I put on my plate and any food left in the middle of the table is covered and put in the fridge. It baffles me that there are people that don't do this. How can you just throw away perfectly good food? I agree that it's a huge waste of money and horrible for the environment.
<br><br>
I haven't been to Europe, but eating less while having the same fullness sounds like a great thing. It would be great if we could implement that here in the U.S., but it is unlikely to happen since the ad campaigns here push for more, more, more.
<br><br>
The dining commons at UCSB seem like they do waste a ton of food. I think a solution to this would be to order/reserve ahead of mealtime so that they don't have to make unnecessary food. Carrillo already does this for breakfast and weekend brunches with their eggs. The only way to get eggs is by filling out a slip saying how many you want and how you want them cooked. If this method was applied to all of the food that they served, it would greatly reduce the amount of wasted food.
<br><hr>
I also grew up in a household that did not like to waste food, so starting from a young age I learned to be food conscious and only get what I could finish. When I came to college, it also hurt me to see people getting plates and plates of food and only taking one bite before throwing it away because perhaps they did not like the taste. Especially when that food is animal waste, I feel like college students don’t take into consideration where their food had come from and that many processes had to happen in order for them to receive the food that was so graciously handed to them. I feel as if it’s a vicious cycle, as people throw away uneaten food and the dining halls continue to think they need to provide more because it’s being eaten so quickly. In reality, food is being thrown away at the consumer’s discretion without much thought at all. I believe personally that our dining halls should not be all you can eat and should be more of a made to order type system so that people can think more about not only the food they’re putting into their bodies, but also about how much food they actually can consume in any given time. This would make UCSB a more environmentally friendly campus and would promote healthy lifestyle choices for it’s students.
<br><hr>
Your comment is very well-written and already covers a lot of what I want to say on the subject of reducing food waste. In fact, many restaurants around the world have already followed suit by making more reasonable portions and imposing a penalty for wasted food (for example, $10 if more than 300 grams is wasted); this can actually drive a positive change as people will begin to rethink how much food to order, before finding themselves with too much leftovers. I think that it's also very important to ask the restaurant about how big their portions are - for instance, I was just at a place today that sold very large plates of food, so that inquiry saved not only my money but also carbon footprint - if I had unintentionally ordered more food than I wanted, simply throwing it away would make me feel extremely guilty, and taking away & refrigerating would add to greenhouse gas emissions (as we've seen from Project Drawdown, it's the #1 most damaging cause!)
<br><br>

I think that we really have to change our consumer culture in order to have any chance of reducing waste; many chains are advertising all-you-can-eat and buy one, take one options, so to make customers think that they are getting a lot of value for their money; but in reality, you never need more than one entrée, and consuming more than you need is simply greedy and unsustainable, not only for personal health but also for this planet. And yes, we need to make the environmentally-conscious lifestyle stand out as more desirable...



<br><hr>
I like how you mentioned portion sizes in Europe; food waste appears to be part of our culture at this point. We don't really think about the detriments of throwing away our leftovers instead of saving them or not making too much at all. 
<br><br>

I'm intrigued by the public policy ideas that Ken mentioned such as a carbon tax and climate labels in Denmark. As an Economics student, I can see how just by attributing incentives to not consume carbon or certain food products, we can mitigate the crisis. The climate label idea really got me -- often, people want to be environmentally-conscious, but either don't know/don't want to research how their individual choices are impacting the environment. According to a quick Google search, the labels are planned to reflect the "water and land usage, life-cycle analysis, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon footprint from transport" of food. Imagine the guilt one would feel from buying a pound of beef, well-knowing that that it used "2,500 gallons of water, 12 pounds of grain, 35 pounds of topsoil and the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline" to produce (earthsave.org). Imagine what kind of a social taboo it would become to purchase products with a high environmental impact. That's another social incentive on top of the moral incentive of having a climate label on food products. 
<br><br>

To answer Ken's question, the idea of a climate vanguard seems like an urgent and necessary initiative, as he seems to think as well. The incentives created by public policy can be so powerful that it can definitely change a culture. And that's exciting!
<br><hr>

I too grew up in a house where we would save leftovers. I can understand why some households would throw away their leftovers because they would get tired of the food, but why not just create a smaller portion of food instead of throwing it away and wasting money by buying too much? Not only would it save our planet by not wasting food, but it would save your money because you would use less ingredients. For restaurants, anything that I do not finish while dining-in, I will simply ask for a to-go box to finish it at a later time. These simple solutions could ultimately save us money and our planet.


<br><hr>
I agree with most of what you said. My family always saves leftovers, we freeze food if we know we won’t be able to eat all that was made, and we never overfill our plates, we grab a little bit and if we want more we go for seconds,  as well as composting some of the leftover, and all of this greatly helps reduce waste in our household. 
<br><br>

However, I disagree with you on the UCSB dining halls being set up to waste tremendous amounts of food. They definitely waste some food, but the biggest wasters are us, the students. The dining halls compost, they try to serve leftover desserts and dishes in different meals, they use the fruit that are ripening too fast to make cakes, etc. and they are doing a tremendously good job at making small portion sizes that will enable a person to have the full portion of what is being served. However, students are the ones that grab 20 things at a time and sit down, only to eat half and find out they weren’t that hungry and toss out the rest. The students need to reevaluate how they’re eating, and instead of going crazy on the buffet, grabbing only 1 or 2 things at a time before going for seconds. If they want to try a new dish, try it with a friend or two so that if one doesn’t like it, then maybe someone else will and the food won’t go in the trash. People need to be educated on their behavior, and that’s how most of the waste produced in the dining halls will be reduced.
<br><hr>


I was also raised to eat all my food and to save any leftovers. As a kid I never realized why I had to do this but now I understand the major positive impact it has on the climate crisis. I also had friends with families that would throw away the leftovers after ever meal. I feel that being wealthy is linked with wasting food because they do not care about the cost of food and do not value it as much as a poorer person would. Because the US is the wealthiest nation, it means we also waste a lot of food. The US needs to make steps to reduce food waste and raise awareness to this individual cause. It is as easy as buying less food, which also saves you money. Another easy way reducing food waste is to reduce food portion sizes, which you said you observed in Europe. This is a smart idea because most of the food we waste is at restaurants. This could also be implemented into the UCSB dining commons, because like you said they waste a tremendous amount of food everyday. This is because students grab a variety of foods and dont ending up eating all of it because the portions are too big. People need to get "tricked" into being more sustainable for the environment as soon aa possible.

<br><hr>
I think the core of the issue with food waste in general is the fact that as Americans, we take it for granted. Since food is so cheap, convenient, and bountiful, a vast vast majority of Americans simply don't know what it means to go days on end without a meal. We are absolutely plagued by gluttony. It is always so interesting observing my grandparents (who are immigrants from Morocco) and their eating habits because although they live a much more affluent lifestyle in America and can afford to indulge in and waste all the food they desire, they still make every single scrap of food count and never waste anything. To them, there is no such thing as leftovers because they understand from their childhood and upbringing living poor that food is what gives us life and thus should not be taken for granted and should be cherished. It is a lesson that unless you've had to starve, it is hard to understand. Seeing my grandparents appreciation for food has inspired me greatly to cut down on my own food waste and to encourage others to do the same.
<br><hr>
I grew up the same, can’t leave the table until everything is off the plate. Unfortunately, that’s not how it is in every household, restaurant, or buffet. We throw away more food than we consume, and we also tend to buy more than we need, why? Is it because of societal pressure? We aren’t living in the past where if you had a shit ton of food that meant you were well off, so why do we buy so much? 
<br><br>

I’ve also thought about the dinning commons here in SB and how the most likely throw away a lot of the food that doesn’t get eaten. I work at one of the dinning commons and I overheard a cook state that there was a lot of chicken left over and that he would take it home if they let him because they were going to throw it away anyhow. It really upset me to hear that and hope we can somehow do something about that of somebody isn’t trying to already.
<br><hr>
I've also been thinking a lot about the impact of the dining halls at UCSB in trying to eat more sustainably... It's crazy that even if people were to only eat vegan options in the dining halls (of which there are very few) they are still paying for so much excess meat and dairy. Regardless, it is so difficult to find good vegan in general. I think that while a big responsibility DOES lie with the consumers (us) it will ultimately be up to producers to stop the unsustainable practice of selling red meat. Especially for students, cheap, filling, and healthy food is super important. There needs to be more plant based protein readily available that isn't extremely expensive.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, I also noticed that the serving size is not reasonable in some restaurants. I'm the type of person who hates wasting so I always try my best to finish my food. However, I'm not allowed to eat too much due to some reasons, so the large size of food my family usually orders is very annoying for me. Just as you said about the dining halls at our school, I'm sure they got a ton of food left after every meal, but I barely see these leftovers appear on the menu of the meal after. I agree that food-wasting is a serious problem in not only the US but many other countries all over the world. From my perspective, the government needs to solve this issue first before talking about other plans for saving our planet.

<br><hr>
I also grew up with that same idea that we had to finish everything on our plate or save leftovers. It surprised me to see a lot of people didn’t participate in that. Often times, going to restaurants you see tons of food left on plates which then go to waste. Portion sizes in the US are unnecessarily big which causes people to waste food. I think more restaurants should decrease their sizes in order to limit this from happening. I also agree about the dining halls and the amount of food that must be wasted at our school. Although we could be doing our part for the environment by eating a largely plant-based diet there's still a huge amount of food that gets wasted from the dining halls. I liked that you mentioned we need to gain people to “follow the herd” because the more people see others living sustainably, the more likely they are to make the switch and follow.
<br><hr>
I have to say, I agree with what you said about saving food. I have always saved any food not eaten as leftovers. My family would always save food and have it the next day or sent it with the kids to school for lunch. I believed that was common practice. Why would people not save the food they didn't eat for later. I then started paying attention to my friends parents as they either tossed the leftovers in the trash or into the garbage disposal. Many families find leftovers gross or boring. Another point that you made was the dining halls. I am a freshman. Everyday, I watch tons of people putting plates full of food onto the dish rotators. It is amazing. I mean half of them look basically untouched. I would assume that they take all fo that food and throw it away immediately. They cant keep food touched by students. But the question I have had, is what they do with food they don't hand out? I would hope that they could save some or give it to a homeless shelter. Sadly I think they simply just throw everything out and don't save any of it. I mean that is a huge waste of food! And it is not just the dining halls. Restaurants and honestly anywhere that sells food, throws and wastes tons of their food. Grocery stores will throw out perfectly good food when it gets t be a certain shelf life. This society of waste is awful and if change isnt made, the situation is just going to get way more worse. We are headed towards some serious problems some that we are already experiencing.
<br><hr>
I, too, was always taught to eat everything I was provided as well as to save leftovers from wherever they came from. Though I didn’t come to the understanding of food waste through an event that occured at a friend's house, I did happen to slowly come upon the realization that people wasted food through experiences I had at restaurants when I was younger. Whenever I went out to eat with my family, I always happened to notice how much food was left on peoples’ plates when we either walked to or from our table. Though I didn’t think much of it then (or anything of it), it comes to remind me now that wealth plays a major contributing factor to the amount of methane and C02 waste we have today. The ability for people to afford fancy meals shipped in from luxurious places leads to mass amounts of C02 pollution (due to how far said food had to travel). On the contrary, the affordable food available to most tends to come in large portions, leading people to not feel as guilty when discarding it rather than saving it. Both of these have major impacts on the environment, and until we figure out how to do so, they will continue to do so. The statement you made about European portions in comparison to Americans is extremely interesting to me. I have never actually traveled to Europe, but referencing back to Cowspiracy and how it was discussed that Europe is attempting to start the revolution against climate change, I totally believe the portion sizes to be much smaller. Not only do these smaller portions help reduce food waste, they also have the ability to be healthier alternatives, which could explain the weight difference between the average American and European. Like you said, if we can manage to lead the “herd” of Americans into believing that smaller food portions are one of the most important changes we can make, the possibility of this actually happening will increase. All in all, I really enjoyed the statements you put forth in your comment!

<br><hr>
You got me thinking about UCSB dining halls and their waste. I've only eaten in the dining hall once during orientation but I can't imagine they do anything but waste the extra cooked food of that day. I wonder if it's given to those who can't afford food? I feel like I'd have known about that. That's something prideful for an organization to do, feed the less fortunate. Therefore, I doubt they do do this. Hmm. Ugly.
<br><br>
I like your idea about tricking people into living for sustainably. I don't know how to accomplish that but if a mass of people can be tricked into something thats better for them and everyone else? I'm on board. I think a big pusher towards people having more sustainable lifestyles is the introduction of vegetarian/vegan based restaurants/eateries. This way its more accessible and the trend thrives. However the issue with this, if the food options are unchanging, during certain seasons as Ken said, there's not big benefit towards the environment depending on certain ingredients.

<br><hr>
I can completely relate to what you said about eating everything off my plate! My family made it a point to make no waste of food and even had superstitions like for every grain of rice you leave in your bowl, a pimple will be on your significant other will have. Looking back, it's extremely silly but overall, taught me a lesson to not create food waste that I still abide by today. Like you, I noticed that many people do not share this same sentiment towards food. My friends would be quick to resort to throwing food out and I found myself offering to eat it, even if I wasn't necessarily hungry. Food waste is a huge problem in America, which honestly sucks because so many Americans go hungry every day. I think food waste is a global issue, but particularly bad in America. You mentioned that in Europe portion sizes are much smaller yet still fulfilling; I think America should adopt smaller portions. It seems that American food portions continue to grow, the existence of extra large cups being an example. Larger portions are even usually more cost efficient, which encourage people to buy larger portions because it's more "worth it", yet when it isn't finished, it's easily thrown out. 
<br><br>
I actually I had no idea how the dining halls dealt with excess foods so I looked it up. On UCSB's sustainability page, it states, "At the University of California, Santa Barbara, Residential Dining Services actively donates leftover and surplus food products to local food banks, the Rescue Mission, and the Santa Barbara Food Bank." I'm glad that excess food is donated, but I think more information should be provided. The statement simply says food is actively donated, but is this every day? And if not, is all the surplus food thrown out? If yes, that is terrible because I know for a fact more food is made than consumed at the dining halls. There needs to be major changes, and to answer Ken's question, no we should not wait for everyone to be on board but start now. Sustainable practices need to be popularized and known!
<br><hr>
I agree whole-heartedly with your comment. I was also raised to not waste food and leftovers were a big thing in my family. Not only is this financially beneficial, but it reduces a great deal of unnecessary waste that is released. I find it especially annoying at restaurants when the portion sizes are super large, almost as if there is meant to be food left over. A lot of restaurant food doesn't keep very well, so a lot of people don't take the leftovers home, forcing the restaurant to throw it away. I know that in other countries, portion sizes are a lot smaller. Even in Canada, the portion sizes at restaurants are so much smaller in comparison to what we have here. People I know in Canada always make fun of our large portion sizes, and they call a large helping of food "American sized". This just proves that large portion sizes are very unnecessary. It is not only up to restaurants to serve smaller sizes, it is up to Americans to stop demanding larger portions.

<br><hr>
Same, I grew up saving left overs. When we cooked for the family and even for parties and gatherings too. Made too many tamales for Christmas? Guess who's eating tamales all winter break? All jokes aside, whether you had left over pozole, tamales, and really any type of guizo you don't go around throwing perfectly good food away. All that hard work/labor that went into having the ingredients at the table and then the labor that went into cooking gone to waste. Not to mention you paid for it, just for you to throw it away, how does that make sense? And you tell me what's wrong with eating the same food you cooked or bought a day ago or even days ago? Y'all just been conditioned to think it's gross or unnecessary. We literally invented the fridge for the purpose of preserving food for longer periods, can we all just chill. I don't consider my economical standing to be a factor because I would still save food even if I was economically stable but that could also be because I grew up conscientious about money and the environment.
<br><br>
I have friends who throw away their left overs and it always troubles me, like dude you have a fridge just save it, you may not want the food today but you may later. Also we all don't have that kind of money laying around. Some of my friends work at the dining commons and they always talk about the insane amounts of food they throw away every night. To us who struggle with food security and are concerned about the ecological effects, that's all kinds of messed up.
<br><hr>
When I was younger, I too was raised to clean my plate and to not waste any food. As I got older, I realized that this mentality wasn’t necessarily correct because it could lead to unnecessary discomfort from fullness or weight gain. I realized that the root of the issue was creating that excess of food in the first place. I see food wasted so much, especially at the dining halls. It really is the more privileged people that waste the most food because they don’t see the value in it. It is disposable, and so easy to just buy another burger or pizza instead of saving leftovers. Eating at the dining halls is frustrating because I often try to eat a high protein low carb diet. However, because of how the food is set up, they end up filling up bowls with mostly rice or noodles and giving very very little protein, probably as a way to save money. As a result, I often have to leave bowls of rice or noodles wasted because I can’t eat it. I wish the dining halls were more of a self serve service where you could take what you wanted or needed (like just chicken or just rice) instead of being forced to recieve it together as one unit. I feel like that would definitely help reduce food waste. It is sad watching the dining hall's conveyer for dirty dishes filled with food with only a bite taken out of it, or food that was left untouched.

<br><hr>
I have a very similar perspective when it comes to food. I was always taught as a kid to eat everything on my plate. Both my parents are somewhat conscious of both money and the environment, so they hate wasted food. I agree with you, American portions are usually way too large. It is definitely a reason for Americans being more overweight on average than in other countries. I remember a few years back, I read a study that said eating on smaller plates can actually help reduce portion size. Just by owning smaller plates, people tended to put less food on the plate, and would only go back for more if they were truly hungry. This could be something to try out for anyone who feels they overeat. I like your idea of “herd mentality”, or in other words making it the cool thing to do to be environmentally friendly (kinda like in 21 Jumpstreet). I think that we need to be activists and force our politicians to begin implementing rules that will help shift our culture towards wasting less and eating more plants. In addition, I have the same problem with the dining commons at UCSB also. I know that all you can eat is definitely creating a lot of food waste, and I hate to see my money go towards that. One point Ken made in the lecture that I completely overlooked in the past was where our food comes from. Knowing that locally sourced food is significantly better for the environment than food flown in from other areas is something important to keep in mind. I like Denmarks idea for a carbon fact label similar to that of a nutrition facts label, this could really help people keep track of what’s healthy for the planet. I still believe there’s hope for us, but we need to make a cultural change when it comes to how we eat.

<br><hr>
I grew up this same way, always being told "what you put on your plate you eat". In fact as incentive my brother and I were given a piece of chocolate only if we finished everything on our plate. I often ate y plate clean until my mom would jokingly say the plate didn't even need to be washed. But I also agree that at Ucsb this is harder to do because you aren't always choosing your portion sizes, and you are choosing so many different flavors of food, due to the appealing buffet style, and end up taking way too much food that doesn't get eaten. I can't remember a meal where everyone at the table finished everything they had. With excessive food being made at the dining halls, and no proper system to make the right amount of food or preserve what's leftover, this is largely adding to the problem.
<br><br>
I think in America "bigger is better" is the motto for a lot of things including the food industry. Portion sizes continue to grow and causes food waste to grow as well. It is crazy to think that we make enough food in the world to feed everyone however such large amounts of people are starving. I think food is cherished more when in smaller amounts, and is much more environmentally friendly. However as consumers continue to buy big portions, big portions will continue to be made.

<br><hr>
My grandma grew up in New York during the Great Depression.  Food waste was never something that was acceptable in my family.  It wasn't a punishment either.  If there was food on your plate you were lucky to have it and unless it was going to make you sick it was going to be eaten. I was happy about this as a kid honestly,  I was always so hungry that clearing my plate was an excitement.  But that in no way stops us from being one of the most wasteful societies on the planet right now.  Thinking about how little of the food we grow makes it to the table is staggering.  Of the 1/3 of food that is discarded before it can reach retailers, I am sure not 100% of it is foul or inedible.  It is so transparent how much of an issue it is to dispose edible food.  But the worse part is all of the wasted space.  That is 1/3 of land that could just be saved. Everything could be saved.  The land deforested to sustain farms, the gallons of water allocated to grow the food, emissions from industrial farms, and poisoning from mass use of pesticides.  It just seems like a ridiculously malicious practice and I cannot believe that it is sustained and not a larger concern of the food industry to address.  It just is scary at this point, how disconnected these industries are from anything other than the board room.  It is glaring how each leg of the industry just provides more and more senseless destruction.  I hope that there might be a way to cut down this waste so the pressure is relied slightly from the consumer and can fall more heavily on wasteful industrial food growth.

 I also grew up in a house where we need to finish everything on our plate, and we are not allowed to waste anything. Therefore, my brothers and I formed a good habit of saving food. At first, I thought that's what everyone else did. And then I found out my friends' parents don't force them to finish all the food. If they don't want to eat, they can just throw them away. Because of this, I thought my family is very poor, so we don't have money to waste any food. I told my thoughts to my mom and promised her that I won't waste any food. My mom laughed at me and told me that they teach us to save food, not because of money, but they want us to learn to treasure grain and cherish the fruits of the labor of others. They might don't think that this good habit will also benefit our environment. I have to thank my parents who taught me this important lesson when I was young and help me to get used to it. When I grew up, every time I have dinner with my friends at restaurants, I will advise them not to order so much food at the beginning, and if we need more, we can add. When I came to America, I was surprised by the portion size even though my friend and I together can't finish one portion. I noticed that not every American can eat that much. An enormous amount of food is wasted in America. Wasting food is not only wasting money or disrespect to others' work but also harms our planet by releasing more carbon dioxide. I believe changing our eating habits is the most accessible and easiest way to cut our carbon footprint, and we can do it right now rather than waiting for others to do it.

Your comment was super interesting to me because I was not exactly taught to eat every single thing on my plate. I was taught that it was normal to just eat until you are full and to never force yourself to eat more because it will make you sick. Although I was taught that, as I grow older and as I watched this lecture I understand how we are wasting an enormous amount of money and how food waste is creating a negative impact on our earth. I love the points you make about looking at portions sizes all over the world and also comparing the way others eat to yourself. The United States is a place with huge portion sizes. If you go to a restaurant, you are consuming about your whole day's calories in one meal which is absolutely INSANE. A tremendous amount of food is wasted everywhere, the dining halls at UCSB, LAUSD cafeterias, restraints, grocery stores and even my sorority house buffets. It is quite funny that the UCSB's dining halls are considered leaders in sustainability when it comes to campus dining in the United States. In order to make a change, I believe we need to have smaller proportions for everything in order to reduce landfill. In the past, I used to make one big trip and buy a ton of food for the month which will end up going bad. But now that I am making weekly grocery trips , I buy what I need to get me through the week and end up using every single bit. I also try to have a plant-based diet twice a week but I find myself struggling with that.

I am so glad someone brought up the dining commons. I worked there my freshman year (awful experience btw do not recommend), however one thing that would always throw me off was how much food gets wasted on both e producer and consumer end. When I would work dish duty I kid you not in the span of an hour, we would easily fill up 4-5 big trashcans of scraps. Not food that wasn't used, food that people grabbed and decided not to eat. I would find myself constantly wheeling out literally buckets of scrap food. A lot of it was left untouched too if I'm being honest. For being the school that is supposed to pave the way for the environmental studies I was appalled and disgusted at how much UCSB student's waste.  I understand maybe not all of the food is good, however people really need to start being more mindful on how they consume. I do like that this is a fixable solution, however. No one is really stuck to these bad habits and they can be unlearned.
<br><hr>
I had the same exact experience in my house growing up.  My parents would always lecture me if I left food on my plate about how wasteful it was and how there are starving children around the globe etc.  When I was young I never really listened, but they were right we as a country waste so much food on a daily basis.  I loved that you mentioned portion sizes because in my opinion that's one of the biggest problems in America.  I have friends from Australia and while in America they were shocked by our gigantic portion size .  They explained to me that their large pizza was the same size as a small here in the states.  We eat way too much.  I feel like we are the nation of excess and that is a huge problem when it comes to the climate crisis as a ton of waste and Carbon Emissions comes with that.  I think the idea of leading the herd and if I am being honest is the best shot we have of getting people to change their habits.  Lets face it most people won't change unless it will benefit them in some way so if we could make it cool to be vegan or to take public transport it would give society motivation to make a change.

<br><hr>
I am also a person who always finishes all the food on my plate. It is very difficult to ask every single one on the planet to do so, but I am able to control myself and persuade my family to finish all the food. Actually such a good habit was taught by my parents when I was a kid. Regarding air travel, I do agree that many people in the world depend on airplanes. It is hard to eliminate everyone on the planet to take air travel. However, it is easy to "make a decision" to NOT take the airplane. Of course, it is hard to take this step.
 <br><br>

Ken said in this video that he stopped air travel. This means that Ken could no longer be able to attend international conferences or even national conferences. I admire his spirit a lot, and I respect his decision. However, I think Ken should consider that he is a great teacher who is also a soldier that fights the climate crisis. If he could go to an international conference and persuade more people to make a decision. More people would behave more environmentally friendly, then he should attend those meetings. Even though he made an air travel and emitted a lot of greenhouse gases, he eliminates or decreases a significant amount of greenhouse gases from the planet by changing others' bad lifestyles.

I noticed the same thing when I visited Europe! I remember when I was in Amsterdam, a lot of restaurants we went to had many plant-based options, I remember eating a lot of lentils. Their portion sizes were also significantly smaller. It was very different compared to what I see in America, with our huge serving sizes and enormous soft-drink cups. It's unfortunate that a lot of American food culture is centered around large portions and lots of meat, considering this is detrimental for the environment, as we now know. So going forward, the solution is going to be changing our culture. I think we're already on a somewhat good track, to be honest. At least in a lot of U.S. cities, many newer restaurants seem to have vegan or plant-based options, and it seems like alternative milks are also becoming very popular. If we continue on this route of changing culture and perceptions, and teach future generations this information, I think there's a lot of hope on this issue, at least on the demand side. Also, I agree with you that being a college freshman at UCSB presents many challenges to being a mindful and deliberate eater with the environment in mind. We basically have what the dining halls give us, and to be totally honest, a lot of the food is so bad that I take a few bites and am done with it, and it probably just goes to waste. I guess I can't claim to know exactly what the university does with its food waste, but still, I see a lot of uneaten food whenever I'm putting my dishes away at the dining halls. It's unfortunate.
<br><hr>
As someone who has worked in the dining halls, I can tell you for a fact that a lot of food is wasted.
 <br><br>

After doing the math, I see about that around 600 pounds of food wasted A DAY. (I got this number after measuring several garbage cans full of food after my Dish shift, then multiplying it out to account for the rest of the meals. It is in no way completely accurate and merely come from my limited observations/estimated guess)
 <br><br>

The dining hall system does encourage the students to waste food, with infinite plates being offered and the food "magically" going away after one puts on a moving metal conveyor, we often don't think about where the food ends up.
 <br><br>

Well, as someone who's been on the opposite side of that conveyer, I'll tell you. We grab your half eaten meal and scrap it into a garbage can, filling 3 for every shift. I can often tell which meals were not popular that day if I say the same food not being eaten. The food fills up our three garbage can limit to the point where we have to continuously compress the scraps into the garbage can to make room for more food. It's extremely saddening to see complelty uneaten plates go down the garbage can. 
 <br><br>

One of my saddest moments of the job was my first night, at the end of my shift, all the food that wasn't served was dumped into a trash can right in front of my eyes. I had to watch one of the chefs throw away and entire pot of tazaki sauce! :,( Throwing away food was at first the most difficult and heartbreaking part of my job, but after a while it seemed like second nature and I was no longer bothered by it. 
 <br><br>

Despite several pounds of food being wasted, I must give credit to UCSB for attempting to solve this issue the best they can. We are tasked with separating food items into compost from trash (this is why you won't find a trashcan in the dining halls!) So all of the biodegradable waste does get composted! When we serve, we're forced to serve small portions, and although it seems annoying as a student, it's crucial to preventing waste. Even with such tiny portions, people will still often through away their entire meal if it's not up to par. 
 <br><br>

The chefs try to use things for as much as they can, desserts served can be a couple of days old, food is stored efficiently to maximize its life, old bread is turned into croutons, etc. Food waste is a difficult topic to tackle but the UCSB dining commons are doing their best in trying to solve it.

<br><hr>
 After watching Ken’s video, I found it is very important to have a good diet habit. One is to reduce our leftovers. I do not like to left food in my plates too, not because I was concerned with the climate issue, but I have OCD. I know it is funny but now it seems that it is not a bad thing at all. Wasting no food is never bad. Taking this course for six weeks, I think this course is influencing me a lot. I start to talk to my roommates bout climate issues, and I would suggest them to cook how much they need and take how much they need to the plates, and it is making progress, which makes me really happy to see all the changes we make.
<br><hr>
I thought you brought up a good point when your stated that European portion sizes are relatively smaller than average American portion sizes. I think this comes from the fact that the United States has an ideology that "bigger/more is better". This ideology has led us to the environmental crisis that we are in today. Think about it. Food is just one example of how the United States has adapted into a "more is better" ideology. Cars, houses, and utilities are other few examples that have become excessive over the past few years and are large contributors to the climate crisis. I also think that although we have large portion sizes in America, we still end up eating the same amount that Europeans do and waste whatever remains. This way of living is not sustainable at all and needs to be fixed in order to resolve issues of the climate crisis. I think a possibility to eliminating food waste is to propose a fast food tax. This tax would make Americans reassess the way that they eat and question if it is really worth it to eat out. 
 <br><br>

It is kind of a sad way of thinking that turning to a plant-based diet would to little since there is so much food being wasted everyday. However, it is true and like you said the first solution to this ongoing problem is to eliminate waste. We as a society need to do a better job of being sustainable, particularly when we buy food. Whenever buying food, it should be a question of "Will I actually eat this" instead of "This looks good. Hopefully I like it". I also liked the analogy you made about the dining commons. It is ridiculous the amount of waste that the dining commons end up with and this needs to be reassessed not only at UCSB, but at all campuses.

<br><hr>


I really enjoyed how you stated how people will follow the "herd" in whichever direction is most popular. I would like to combine that also with your previous statement of how Americans tend to eat more than other countries. At some point in time, America as a whole grew into this "bigger is better" and "more is never enough" attitude and mindset that we have been stuck in for a very long time. We often associate this mindset to things; such as fashion, success, friends,  material, etc. , but we rarely ever hear about this in regards to food. For some reason, we label in a separate category from these things and know it only as a lifestyle, but is it not the same concept? I think, that this concept was pushed (specifically in food) during the rise of today's top industries. The introduction of 52 seasons a year in fast fashion is equivalent to upgrading from eight pieces of chicken nuggets to a 10 piece combo at a fast food restaurant - even if we don't finish it. We do this, because we can. Because there is only a dollar difference between the eight piece and the 10 piece so hey, it wouldn't make sense to NOT get them. We eat more and get bigger servings because we are introducing new ways to make artificial food in times when crops are not sustainable or reliable enough to rely on large demands of supply. The one way we can fix this is like you said, lead people into the "right" direction, and also to hold the industries that are profiting the most off of our stuck mentalities accountable for trying to keep America healthy, not just poison us and leave us to rot.

<br><hr>
I, too, was raised in a household in which we were expected to finish everything on our plates at each meal. The same went for leftovers. I also only began to realize that this is not that common of a practice or mindset in most American households as I grew older and went to friends’ houses and went out to restaurants with peers. I asked the same questions. I wondered why people put so much food on their plate if they knew they weren’t going to eat it, bought grocery items that were going to sit around until tossed out upon expiration, and most of all pick at their restaurant order then proceed to let the waiter take their plate away. I began to notice this more and more as I entered college as well. The rotating dish return station in each of the dining commons here are always filled with barely eaten foods and it makes me think about the people who put time into making the food, the money spent on the food, the people that could have eaten that food, and the effects this behavior has on the environment. Wasting food for me, came with guilt and feelings of irresponsibility, and I feel like if more people felt this way, food waste would decrease greatly. I definitely think we need to stop normalizing wasting large amounts of food, and hopefully this will lead to people thinking twice before they buy, make, and consume their food.
<br><hr>
Me too! I never even thought about other countries' portion sizes, as I've never travelled outside the U.S. I grew up learning to eat everything that I can on my plate. In fact, when I feel full and if there's still something on my plate, I still try to eat it but I most likely end up saving it as leftovers. It was shocking to me when other people didn't do the same, when there was still so much food left and they were on their way to toss it in the trash. And it's everywhere. A lot of money spent just for it to be wasted, like shouldn't you want to save it for later?
 <br><br>
I'm so glad you mentioned the dining commons here at UCSB, and any dining commons in the US really. Ever since taking this class, I can't stop thinking about the food wasted because of the demand trying to keep up with feeding all of the students and people, and all the food tossed away at the end of the day. Sure, it's great we don't have a tray system so less food is being wasted. But at the end of the day, I'm sure whatever people didn't eat is just thrown away. And though the tray system is great, we need to get everyone on board for something as small as that. Schools like UCLA still have trays in the dining commons. Just in general, there won't be change unless we cut the unnecessary waste just like you've stated.

<br><hr>
I agree that we should lead the heard in the right directions. Before my parents migrated to the United States apparently they only had meat on certain occasions. Sometimes on birthdays, holidays, or generally special occasions. They generally had a balanced diet of grains fruits and vegetables alongside animal byproducts like eggs and milk that they raised on their family land. They killed the animals that they spent so much time raising and only did so at certain times. Yet today in the United States they seem to think everyday is special occasions. Growing up we usually had a meat protein like beef chicken or pork at least once a day. I asked my parents if they ate like this when they were kids and they said no. Meat was something that parents had to work for and was a sign of prestige and wealth. But large scale production of meat in this country have lead my family easy accessibility to this so called glamour is lifestyle. But if glamour is causing this planet to burn then I think it’s time we redefine what means to be glamorous.

<br><hr>
I agree with Tess’s statement. I think people have to change their eating style that people should not waste food. First of all, I think people should pack food less but with more times. Take me for example, if I have meal in cafeteria, I could first put a little bit salad and pizza. If I still feel not full, I could take another pasta. I think this way could help me to avoid wasting. What’s more, people should eat more vegetable instead of meat. What I also think is that government should also make a tax on emit pollutions such as carbon dioxide, polluted water, and garbage. If government have relevant policies, people and company would definitely make change to pollute less.

<br><hr>
This is such an important argument and comment! The amount of food both made at colleges/wasted by the students is a major issue. After learning that 1/3 of the food in the US is being wasted, I am definitely more inclined to eat smaller portions/ buy less so my things don't spoil, and never again support on campus dining. Your view about European countries is so eye-opening. I've never been out of the country, but I think that smaller portions and more conscious food preparation would help the US immensely. Not only would smaller portions helps our nation's health (with the US being one of the most unhealthy countries in the world), it would help the environment immensely. Before this unit on food waste in our class, I was not at all aware of the major impact that food waste has on the planet, and now that I know, I am going to do my absolute best to make sure that I have no part in it. 
 <br><br>
Thank you for sharing this view about the campus dining- it's really an issue that should be taken to an administrative level because UCSB claims to be environmentally friendly- but yet contribute in a big way to food waste.
<br><hr>
I too was raised in a household that prioritizes eating everything on our plate. I was a bit of a picky eater when I was younger, so I was always given the "a starving child would be so grateful for the food you are wasting" speech from my mom. I feel like this is the sort of mentality every parent should drill into their children. Whenever I eat at the dining commons, I make sure to only take what I know I will finish. Whenever I go to return my plates to the conveyor machine, I always see plates filled with partially-eaten food. It's so disappointing to see so much food go to waste---especially because I know that UCSB will dump the food waste instead of composting it or something. I agree with you that we need to start making sustainability more "popular" in order to urge society to waste less.
<br><hr>
My family functions in the exact same way! Every night while my brother and I cleared the table and did the dishes, my mom would be packing all of the food we didn't eat into Tupperware. I don't know if it's because we didn't have a lot of money or because my mom was determined to not let her effort be wasted, but one way or another the leftovers would be eaten. Honestly, I find it strange that someone could just throw away the food they worked so hard to provide and make, and is what surprised me the most upon staring dorm life. I'd like to preface this by saying that I don't actually live on campus, but at Tropicana. I often notice that regardless of how much is left in the tray, once the designated time for a meal has ended the food is taken away and tossed out. The tray or the café could be half full and nothing would change. 
 <br><br>

I actually had a discussion about possible solutions with my roommate not too long ago. One solution I suggested was using the leftover food to create a pseudo soup kitchen for the homeless and/or needy. I think we can all agree that Isla Vista has a bit of a homeless problem, and this would be a perfect way to not only do a good deed but help nourish the community. Another option would be to simply allow the kitchen staff to take home as much leftover food as they want. The laborers and staff in the U.C. system are notoriously underpaid, and this could be a way to lighten their load at home. 
 <br><br>

I think you're spot on when it comes to tricking the heard to move towards sustainable lifestyles, and I think this is already happening before our eyes. With the emergence and growing popularity of the minimalistic lifestyle, ideas like tiny-homes and mindful consumerism are really starting to gain footing in our nation's pop culture. I think a perfect start would be to popularize chicken as a viable substitute to beef. It's a relatively small change that, on a large scale, could really free up resources and land that would otherwise be supporting the beef industry while simultaneously reducing the carbon footprint of food production as a whole.

<br><hr>

I did not grow up with a lot of money so food was rarely thrown away in my house; if it was not finished during mealtime then it would've been reheated at a later point in time. I'm thankful for the eating habits that remain because I don't feel as guilty for my carbon footprint in terms of food waste. The first time that I met someone that would throw away leftover food was when I met my SO, which shocked me because I saw no need to throw away all the food away after every meal. I am still trying to convince him to cook in smaller portions, so hopefully lectures like these will help me convince him. 

 <br><br>

I also liked your "follow the herd" comment, not only because joke about cows since we're discussing eating less beef, but because of the ideas you brought up. I think climate vanguards are needed to help make environmentally conscious lifestyles trendy to motivate people to follow along, just like how previously having a meat based diet was made to be popular and therefore still currently is. If the desire for a greener life and diet is not expressed, then how else will we ever convince companies and corporations to comply and create greener alternatives?



<br><hr>


I like how this comment focused on the importance of not wasting food as a primary action of a climate vanguard. The example of the dining commons was fantastic in demonstrating this issue at a large and highly problematic scale. The portions and quality of the food made it very difficult not to create food waste when I was eating at the dining halls and I remember putting away my dishes and noticing stacks of barely touched food lining the dish racks. I also appreciated how you pointed out the other benefits of smaller portion sizes, in that it is easier to eat healthy when less food is actually offered. I thought the last part of this comment where you mentioned “tricking” the herd was definitely necessary but almost against Ken’s idea of a climate vanguard. I do believe that structural change needs to happen in order to make big cultural change possible and it is hard to see how individual activism compares.  It is sort of like a chicken and the egg predicament that we are faced with, can we make the necessary changes to our behavior without the structural changes, and how to we get the structural changes to happen without changes to our individual behavior. Finding this balance is going to prove to be a challenge for the climate vanguards, a challenge that I would hope to face alongside others in this class as we fight for a better future for our planet.



<br><hr>
I completely agree that food waste is one of the main problems we should tackle. The culture around eating in America is both unhealthy and wasteful; portions here compared to other countries are usually double the size, the food is generally unhealthier, and many fast food restaurants end up throwing away old food at the end of the day, contributing to the ever-growing amount of food waste. It’s a by-product of our consumerist society; like with the fast fashion industry, people buy an excess of food and throw away whatever they dislike or can’t finish just as they do when they grow bored of their clothing. Attempting to change how people consume foods and other products requires a cultural shift and a change in ideals that won’t be easily imposed on the boomer generation.
 <br><br>
The dining halls here definitely waste a lot of their food, and the problem is that there are a lot of students who are on low meal plans or don’t have meal plans at all that could eat the food the dining commons end up wasting. The meal donations program is faulty at best because most students don’t know whether they will have remaining meal swipes to give away by the weekly deadline; overall, the system is extremely inefficient and needs to be improved.





<br><hr>

I was raised the same way to always clear my plate. I wish more people were raised the same way like us and I agree Americans are overweight for the portion sizes and I wish I knew how to push away from the table. You are right also about the dining commons but it is hard to manage here at UCSB with the volume of students who may come in or not with meal swipes and should certainly be reevaluated as a system. I agree that we need to find a way to make people act on climate change but not "trick". I think when enough people realize the consequences of our actions people will change, and the climate can change in the right direction.




<br><hr>

I think you brought up a good point by bringing up the tremendous amount of waste produced in the dining commons. From the university's standpoint, it is easy to provide students with a limitless amount of food that is easily accessible for students to take. However, I also noticed that so many students would take plates with a lot of food left over to be thrown out at the end of their meal. By allowing this happen, I believe that many students may carry this habit into their personal lives when they are able to cook their own meals. 
 <br><br>
By preventing food waste, people are able to save money and the environment. There needs to be a cultural change that focuses on the importance of making healthy and well-portioned meals that can help people live more sustainable, financially stable, and healthy lives. It is a privilege for people to have food to throw away when nearly 1/7 of the world's population does not have food to eat. I hope that more people will realize how simple it is to make the transition towards more sustainable eating habits.




<br><hr>
I am totally agreed with your opinion, I have found a lot of food is wasting is not only just the UCSB or any other school’s dining hall. In any restaurant’s table, there must have a few people left something on the plates.
 <br><br>
My dad always convinces me(because he thinks I need to eat less to keep slim): “ if you cannot eat so much, just do not get so much on your plate. You should not only feel sorry about yourself but also feel sorry about the farmers or the producers that create the food.” Yes, so the government or the legal system set rules to keep the food or any other resource to be used balanced that everything will be wasted less. The future of our offspring will be better as well.





<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said about “tricking” the average person into eating more sustainably. You criticized the setup of the dining commons, but they’ve actually employed this technique in an effort to combat waste. Prior to 2009, students would pick up a large tray upon entering the dining commons, which they would feel compelled to fill up with plates of food; once the school did away with these trays, students began taking back to their table only the amount of food that they actually wanted, and making another trip if they wanted seconds. Even though students still had access to the same amount of food as before, the amount of food waste after every meal was greatly reduced, because students were no longer taking more food than they could eat just to fill up a tray. These kinds of subliminal changes can be utilized in many ways in order to get people to cut down on waste: smaller portion sizes at restaurants, smaller plates and utensils in general, and even smaller refrigerators. All of these items have been expanding in size over time, and we seem to feel a subconscious need to fill them; they don’t have to keep growing in size however, and if we want to make a difference we’re going to need to reverse this trend.

 <br><br>

The food waste problem requires inventive solutions. While looking up UCSB’s policy on food waste, I saw a video linked on their website that talked about an app called Copia, started by a former UC Berkeley student. The app allows businesses to donate food that it has left over from events, and Copia employees will come pick up the food and transport it to registered nonprofits and shelters, giving food that would have otherwise gone to waste to those in need. It’s a nationwide service, active in all 50 states, and encourages companies to donate through offering tax savings. I think an idea like this is so important to show how much of a difference someone can make, especially since it was started by a UC student like ourselves, spurred from a decision she made when she bought a meal for a homeless man and heard his story. In addition to personal changes that we make, we all have the chance to make a bigger impact!

I can totally relate to this! I was never allowed to leave the table unless I had eaten every bite on my plate. I hated this as a kid, but now I am so glad that I was raised to appreciate every bit of food in front of me because I was privileged enough to have it in the first place. I can see the difference of upbringings between myself and my friends when we are at the dining commons and they will leave full dishes, desserts, or drinks with only one bite or sip out of them at the busing station. I can never understand how that is okay in their eyes. I can always hear my mom in the back of my head if that were me and I was getting an earful for leaving uneaten food on a plate. Growing up, whenever we sat down for a meal or went out to eat on a Sunday, both of my parents ate every bite that was served to them and I was expected to do just the same. If it was a larger portion and there was a bit of food leftover, we always ALWAYS got it to go to eat later when we were hungry again. We never let food go to waste. My mom today will dedicate her Sunday nights to making a new dish with all of the extra produce left in the fridge at the end of the week. Everything can be used somehow. I will bring this habit with me throughout college and when I have a home of my own. 
 <br><br>


Sometimes this habit to eat all of my food will drive me over the edge a bit and cause some anxieties about eating too much and then being worried about throwing up or something crazy. The key to finding the perfect balance is portion control and slow eating.




<br><hr>
I also always had a mind about food waste, perhaps not in entirely the same way, but I always had a bit of a net beneath me in the fact that my family owns chickens (as pets, not food) and we would always just give our scraps to them because, well, chickens eat everything. Having that safety net made me forget how other people don't have such a convenient way of reducing their waste, but even so, it's a bit unfathomable as to how we've come to just immediately resorting to landfills when there really are other options that are far more sustainable. I might not be vegan, so perhaps it makes sense that it never came to my mind, but you do make a really great point in the fact about how because while you eat vegan you still contribute to mass amounts of food waste through the dining commons simply by paying for it. I sometimes forget that second-hand responsibility we carry, how everything is relative when you get down to it. You're right though, it's almost as though tricking people and forcing people to live more sustainable is the only way to get things across, set an award system or a punishment one in order to emphasize better eating habits.

I come from a home that was raised to eat everything on the plate as well, I was raised to be thankful for the food and never waste it as it was basically a sin to do so. My mom would tell me I was not allowed to leave the table unless I finished everything and she kept her word every time. This was how our entire family was raised and so I was also shocked when I discovered other people weren't raised this way. I was once eating at my friend's house and she left half of the food untouched, she then got up and went to watch tv; her mother then proceeded to tell me I didn't have to finish my food and I could go watch tv as well, this left me in shock. My mom would never. This was a critical moment for me, as I became aware of how differently we were being raised. I could only imagine all the other kids being raised this way; such an entitled way. 
 <br><br>
As you mentioned the dining commons it reminded me of my old high school. I clearly remember the trashcans outside the cafeteria full of untouched food. Most students would go just for the chocolate milk or the packet of apples and throw away the rest. Food waste is one of the major concerns for climate change, but not much is being done. Not much is being done for anything.

I was the complete opposite of what you were when I was growing up. In my family, my mom and I were always known as the ones who would leave something on our plate every time we ate. Whether it was a PB&J and we left the crust or meat on a chicken wing, there was always food left. This infuriated my grandpa as he grew up in the depression and absolutely needed to eat everything on the plate. I believe this dynamic goes back to having to force people into eating sustainably. My grandpa and many other people during the depression were forced to eat all of the food on the plate because there waste was a waste of money. Just as Ken said that we have to force people into eating more sustainably, I think my grandpa's generation shows that raising kids to do eat all the food on their plate or do other sustainable things stays with them throughout their life. I agree with the statement that we need to "trick" people into living more sustainably. It pains me that in order to have a new generation focus on sustainable eating there needed to be a huge depression in order to force it upon people. Unfortunately with the economy doing good and the culture of the US for eating a lot, there needs to be a huge shift. I don't know whether that shift will be forceful or "trick" consumers as you say, but this shift needs to start with parents teaching their children.

I agree, the sheer amount of food we waste is almost unfathomable. Our food system while not only unsustainable, is equally inefficient both in the means of production and at the consumer level. And just as you touched on, the obsession the United States has created with fast food and large proportions poses both an environmental and a public health threat. Today, fast food companies especially have made it easy for people to give into the 'combo that comes with an extra large set of fries' or advertised 'a larger size drink for only 20 more cents' playing into a culture of excessive consumption. 
       <br><br>
 I also agree with your perspective on food waste, especially at a college level. Everyday I see plates half full of food wasted not to mention the uneaten leftover food after the dining halls have closed that are probably also thrown to waste. While I do think it is absolutely necessary we start change by eliminating food waste, I also think its important to inform the public about how their eating habits effect the environment. While I thought I was knowledgable about how my diet effected the environment I have still continued to learn new things about how I can alter my diet and be more conscious of the foods I'm eating. For example, I was completely unaware of just how damaging eating certain foods during varying seasons could be such as Ken mentioned, the consumption of asparagus in North America during the winter. One thing Ken mentioned that I thought was interesting was the climate labels idea. Personally, I would find this extremely helpful to distinguish the more environmentally friendly choice.

I agree, growing up we didn't waste food around the house, we would either put it away as leftovers or give it to someone else to finish.  Those leftovers from dinner would be our lunch the next day and on days where I wasn't hungry enough to finish my lunch at school I would give it to a friend.  There's really no point to throwing away food.  I also felt the exact same way eating in the dining commons last year!  I felt so guilty knowing how much food was going to waste, and I even found myself grabbing way more food than I could eat due to it being buffet style.  Then when you can't eat all the food on your plate they make you throw it away! I was like what??? That's when I really had to make sure my eyes weren't being bigger than my stomach because I hated throwing away all that perfectly fine food (even though I knew there was nothing I could do about it because the amount they throw away every night was far more harmful than anything I was doing.). At restaurants in the United States we get served MASSIVE amounts of food, I often find myself ordering "small plate" options at restaurants, not only is there still enough for leftovers once I'm done eating but I also save money.  I find that it is a culture problem in America where everything has to be "bigger" to be better.



<br><hr>

I agree with you, I grew up being taught to always eat what I served myself or what I was served on my plate. If we ever had extra food we would save it for later and pack away the extra food for leftovers for the next day. It is so sad to see how much people waste food when going out to eat at restaurants. You just paid $15 for that meal and you aren’t even going to finish it or box it up to take home for later? As you said, it is really hard to have little food waste here at school because of the dining commons; they make mass amounts of food and then most likely dump the rest that wasn’t eaten. I am not vegetarian or vegan, but I do not eat nearly as much red meat as I used to when I used to live back home because I have become aware of how much it is affecting our environment. I have tried telling my parents many times to cut back on the red meat and to eat more chicken or turkey and vegetables, but they are just too stubborn to listen and don’t want to give up something “your body needs”. I also think that is a reason to why some people won’t give up beef is because it’s good for you. But what I don’t think people understand is that it takes 48 hours or more for your body to digest it and it only keeps the iron and protein from the beef, the rest of it is digested and pooped out later.

I was also raised with the same mentality with regards to eating. My family grew up in conservative France with lots of farmers on my mother’s side. Wasting food is heavily scrutinized and also seen as disrespectful to the person who cooked it.  I believe it has become such a big issue because, like the climate crisis, the effects of wasting food are indirect and not visibly seen by the offender. Since we are a developed country, it becomes impossible for us to really grasp what famine is like.
       <br><br>

It also makes me incredibly angry that food companies will throw out perfectly healthy but simply slightly deformed food just to not discourage consumers from buying their produce. At the very least, if you are not going to sell that food you should give it to people who need it as opposed to simply throwing it away. What we should do is simply instore laws that prevent food waste. It seems like an overly simplified solution yet it has worked in countries such as Switzerland (for littering that is). If someone gets caught littering or wasting, he/she would simply have to pay a fine proportional to the amount of food he/she wasted or litter he/she didn’t pick up.
       <br><br>

I believe also fundamental changes should be made to the education system we have in the United States. I feel like with all of the different ways the world has evolved in recent years, some parts of the education system really need to be redone. To resolve the issues above, we can implement stronger moral guidelines on wasting and recycling in public schools to encourage the younger generation to be more environmentally aware of their waste products. By doing so, we can also discourage the increasingly rampant consumerism wave that has affected the majority of the people in the United States.

I can completely relate to this comment. When I was at home I always just automatically composted my food. When I came to college, I assumed the same would happen when I would put my half finished tray on the conveyer belt in the dining halls. It wasn't until my friend, who works for the dining halls, told me about how much food goes to waste. After that I was a little more conscious about finishing my food, not wanting to waste it.
       <br><br>
This year, I live in a sorority. We get a meal plan in the house but all of the food we don't eat is thrown away, because apparently it isn't sanitary to be donated or kept for leftovers, and it isn't composted either. I can now honestly say that I have food waste anxiety in college. I feel like I have no control over where the food I don't eat goes, and it scares me a little and makes me feel awful about my impact. I think UCSB could work to reform this, it would be an awesome way for students to use their voice and speak out as well.

I am an international student. When I first arrived in the United States, one thing that impressed me was the serving size of food here. I am not very tall and have a light weight. I can not eat much. But when I go to a restaurant, the smallest choice that I can choose sometimes I can only eat half. Compared to my hometown, the food serving size in the United States is much larger. Not only do I have this problem, but also some people have this problem. When I eat in the restaurant, I always see a lot of people leave a lot of food on the plate. So It would be great if the restaurants have a smaller serving size for customers to choose. And if they do that, I believe some people who do not want to waste food but really can not eat much will not waste food anymore. Also, about the food waste of dining halls, I understand that sometimes dining halls have their own difficulties. They do not want to waste food, but they have to make sure they have enough food for every student to eat, so that they have to make enough food. What I suggest to them is that they may reduce the food when they are going to close or when they see the students are reducing. But honestly, it is really hard to reduce this waste, because no one can perfectly control the number of students in a dining hall at every time, which is a sad fact.



<br><hr>

I strongly resonate with your opinion as I believe it is of vital importance to reduce food wastes, and this is not only an environmental issue but also a social and humanistic issue. Last quarter I was in a class about qualitative research and I did a basic qualitative research on UCSB dining hall's food wastes, in which I interviewed UCSB students, dining hall staffs, and the sustainability manager of UCSB dining commons, which allowed me to see a rather clear and thorough picture of our campus's ways to deal with and manage food wastes. Generally, some student don't waste at all, some do waste guiltily, and some waste relatively frequently. The staffs also said that the food wastes are mostly not going to be reused and it is painful to see some integral dishes to be thrown away. When I talked the sustainability manager, I found a lot of activities and initiatives they have to reduce food wastes, but I think some of them are not advertised enough to get people involved, such as the Miramar food pantry. A lot of activities are helpful, but to mitigate the problem more intrinsically, we students and the dining commons are both responsible. Regarding Ken's question about whether we would be climate vanguards, I think it is always beneficial in the long term to reduce wastes and improve the efficiency of food use so that more people in the people will be fed and starvation can be reduced, which can let more people lead a decent and happier life. In my opinion, there might not be some "vanguards" but rather it is people's mindsets about whether other people and species and the future should be valued and cared, because they they do, then we will definitely treat our environment with care and do things that can benefit human rights and reduce inequality. I believe every moment is a chance to be the change we want to see in the world and make the world a better place, and as long as we have that mindset in our mind, we are probably "vanguards" at every moment.

I was raised the same way! Still to this day, I have to eat everything that I put onto my plate and it always bothers me when I see people throw food away because it has been so ingrained in me to not waste anything.  I found this super hard going into the dining commons when I was a first-year also, because I saw how much people threw away, and I always wanted to try everything but it was impossible for me to only take a few bites of a bunch of different things and then throw the rest away.  Since moving into a house with friends in IV, it's hard to see other people waste food too.  A lot of times my roommates will go to throw perfectly good food away, and often times I'll have to intervene and tell them I would rather eat it than see them throw it away. I also traveled to Europe with my family this summer, and that was the first thing that I noticed.  The prices (once converted from euros to dollars) for meals in restaurants were about the same, but you got significantly less food than you would in America.  I remember ordering gnocchi one of the first nights that we ate food out and being surprised at the tiny amount that I got served, compared to the heaping piles of pasta that you get when you order in America.  

       <br><br>

I agree that America needs to drastically cut down on its food waste.  I think making sustainable practices easier and more tangible for everyone is what is ultimately going to be the driving force into making a difference and treating the environment better.





<br><hr>

You are so right! One of the biggest things we can do in regards to food consumption habits is to drastically reduce (or perhaps totally eliminate) food waste. ONE-THIRD of all food produced in the United States completely goes to waste. While there are some ways to make this waste less detrimental, such as burning biogas created by food waste (biomass) to generate electricity, we should aim to cut down food waste altogether. Starting from the farm, through transportation and storage, all the way to distribution, there are a number of strategies that can be used to decrease the amount of food that gets wasted entirely. After reducing food waste, we can then focus on switching to largely plant-based diets, which will in turn support sustainable farming and agricultural practices. 
        <br><br>

Ken mentioned that people will not begin acting toward mitigating climate change until they have to; that time has come, and yet there is still not enough movement. What we need to do is incentivize motives that reduce the contributors of climate change; we need to make it more difficult to NOT follow sustainable habits than to just follow them. By this, I mean making changes like increasing the price of beef or gasoline or nonrenewable energy, which will turn consumers away from these items and thus aid in the journey to sustainability. As of now, the widespread and rather inexpensive availability of beef (McDonald’s, anyone?), gasoline, and nonrenewable energy is difficult to turn away from. When society grows accustomed to certain ways of living, they will continue to follow the pack, whether in fear of standing out negatively or for more selfish reasons. 
        <br><br>

We need to instill a shift in societal views entirely; around the way we treat the materials that the earth has so kindly given us, the way we view our habits, and the way that we view others’ habits. We need to shift society in a way that going back to our (now current) habits is seen negatively on a large scale. The more changes that we make, the more people will “tag along”, and the easier it will be to continue inflicting positive change.

I, too, was raised to eat everything on my plate and save leftovers. In fact I had a similar experience visiting a friend’s house in middle school. She noticed I was full and said “you don’t have to finish it, you can just throw the rest away.” I ate a little more, but I threw some away, and I felt so guilty. I considered it normal to save leftover food for later, but I learned that not everyone does that. I agree with those who’ve commented that people tend to follow what’s “cool” and by making plant-based, and sustainable food popular, that would bring about a greater number of people who are encouraged to follow a more sustainable lifestyle.


<br><hr>

I also went to a hippie sleep-away camp which introduced me to composting, growing our own food, and having a close-to-zero waste goal. All of the girls at my table all wanted to finish our plates so we could earn our totem for the week and go up to the campfire before everyone else. When I babysit for families, I also like to encourage the children to finish their plates before they go to sleep. I also like to cook with the children to teach them how much effort goes into their meals and educate them on where their food comes from. I wish we could bring that to college in the dining halls because I feel like, with social media, it could become a cool thing!

<br><hr>

Reading your comment made me realize how much America takes for granted and wastes compared to other countries around the world. Portion sizes in the US should be more controlled rather than having large amounts of foods being wasted every single day. I also understand where you're coming from with the whole issue of food being wasted in the dining commons. I can see why there has been an increase in people choosing to switch to plant-based diets. Like Ken said, even if one is just switching to a Mediterranean diet lifestyle, that small change makes a huge impact in the long run. 
        <br><br>
A lot of us students need to work on the amount of time we spend traveling and flying. I know several people who take vacations numerous times throughout the year, but do they know how much their carbon footprint increases each time they decide to travel by plane? Hearing that Ken has coordinated several meetings online helps me think there's still a little hope. If more people decided to conduct conferences this same way, carbon emissions that come from planes would be reduced dramatically.




<br><hr>

Reading your comment, I was inspired and hopeful. I thought, ok, how can we make it so that the dining commons don’t waste so much? We can only make sure that we ourselves eat everything we take and not throw anything away. And there’s nothing wrong with taking friendly jabs at your friends for wasting their food. I’ve found, if they are going to waste it and you say “really??” they’ll either finish or offer it to me. I have little problem being the blackhole of food sometimes. But honestly, after working at the dining commons for a couple quarters, it was really sad seeing at least 4 barrels of food waste tossed every single meal. And I wasn’t perfect about it. If I didn’t like something, I’d throw away near full servings sometimes. And what’s up with people putting milk in their cereal and then not drinking it at the end. If you just want soggy cereal, put water in it or eat the whole thing… There are even times when full muffins would come around and I wouldn’t even hesitate to eat them. Like why waste such good food. Anyway. That’s my take on it.




<br><hr>

I completely agree with your viewpoint on portion size and leftovers. I grew up in a household where we are not allowed to leave leftovers. My parents always encouraged me to eat a lot and never waste food. Upon entering college, it came as a shock to me because at the dining halls we would be able to eat/take as much food as we wanted and leave leftovers if we wanted to because there was no one who could tell us what to do. This is very unsustainable and wasteful to me but there is not much you can do as a college student paying for the meal plan. 
        <br><br>
After watching many of the climate change videos, I have become more apt to not leaving leftovers and contributing to the growing food waste problem. One solution that I have to the food waste problem in the dining halls is to donate that food to the homeless or people in need, instead of just throwing it all out and wasting what is perfectly good food. It angers me that this is such a big problem but I only relate it to the American mindset of just taking what we want. This problem is affecting me because I am a student at UCSB and makes me want to research ways in which we can limit this food waste. Another solution I can think of is for the dining halls to make less food on the days/times that they are less busy and don't anticipate as many students.

I too had an internal conflict when I lived on campus and ate at the dining commons. The convenience of the dining commons is almost unmatched, and to be quite frank, I miss them dearly(because I'm lazy). When I'd eat at the commons, I'd always make sure to eat everything on my plate, and only grab foods I was certain I'd want to eat. Many of my peers, however, did not feel the same way about food conservation. At almost every meal, there were entire plates of food wasted, and it was then that I realized that not everyone's families were as strict as mine when it came to food conservation.
        <br><br>
Growing up, I frequently stayed at my grandparents house, and with 7 other cousins eating with me, food was scarce, to say the least. So, as you might be able to assume, there was never any leftovers. It is shocking to me that so many people are comfortable with disposing of so much food without a second to think about conservation. On the topic of dietary planning, I believe that a shift to a plant-based diet should be the first step in mitigating food waste, as much of the pollutant foods are meat. The shift to a plant-based diet could also help support composting and other natural food disposal techniques, as meat doesn't compost very well in comparison. The primary issue is what we are doing with our waste(dumping) as supposed to composting and preserving it for later.






<br><hr>

I was raised the same way you were, taught to not waste any food and thought everyone was the same. Most of my friends growing up were taught this same way and I didn’t realize that some people really don’t care about food waste until my first year in college. My roommates and I would go to the dining commons and one of them would grab something to eat, take a couple of bites before stating that she didn’t want it anymore and throwing it away. I’ve seen people throw away whole meals and it made me furious. I had only ten meal swipes per week (leaving me with one, sometimes two meals per day) at the dining commons so that my family would not spend as much money on room and board costs while I watched those with more take it for granted. Even without the environmental impact of food waste, there is a very large number of people who are starving or food insecure while some people couldn't care less about how much food they waste.   
        <br><br>
I connect to what Ken said about how someone may switch to a plant based diet and get negative reactions from their family. When my brothers and I decided to go vegan, we got plenty of judgement from our parents and rest of our family. Although we all decided to follow a vegan diet for different reasons, in the end we were all supporting the same cause. When explaining why I decided to go vegan to my family, they said that college has “brainwashed” me. Coming from a hispanic background, there are a lot of dishes that depend on some kind of meat or dairy. 
        <br><br>
I think the climate labels are a great idea. I know that plenty of people that are environmentally conscious, or want to be, would definitely use this. It could also bring into the light that what people eat affects the environment in a number of ways, from shipment to overusing land to cutting down trees in the Amazon for agriculture. I do believe that we need a climate vanguard. I believe that people need to act as soon as possible and start a chain reaction. We’re in a much more dire situation than people think. I would like to believe that if more people knew about the situation we are in and that we have the power to change it, that they would act and follow in our footsteps.

I also grew up in a house that never wasted food, even if we didn't like what was on our plate, we always had so many Tupperware containers left in the fridge and ate on our meals for days, even storing some in the freezer for a later time. So to hear as I got more aware of waste especially related to climate change it was astonishing to me as I was always very conscious in saving food and eating everything. But being in college and eating out more, it's easy to see how so much food could be wasted, the portions you see at Freebirds are double what the average person eats, and yeah it's good given the price point, but the amount of waste that I've seen just sitting there eating is crazy. Our food waste I think is directly related to our portion size, and in trying to be more sustainable I think that preparing our own meals and decreasing portion sizes can greatly decrease food waste.





<br><hr>
I also was raised to always clear my plate and save leftovers, and I had a similar experience with a friend where they were shocked that my house did not need a garbage disposal in the sink because we didn't dump a bunch of food down our sink. Food waste is a horrible way to destroy the planet because there are so many families that are in need of food but can't afford it. I think it's also ridiculous how much food UCSB itself wastes. I worked at a dining common for a while and we would throw out so much perfectly good food. I feel like this is so wasteful especially when we could easily set up a soup kitchen for the homeless.

It still continues to amaze me how little education I had on these issues when I was in high school. I would classify myself as environmentally friendly. I took AP environmental science and was part of the environmental club at my high school. I thought recycling was one of the most important things that I could do. I had no idea how much of an affect eating meat was having, how much food was getting thrown away in the cafeteria, how much of an impact me driving to school every day was having on the planet. If I would have known these things I am sure I would have changed my ways. 
    <br><br>
         This brings me back to Kens Video. If in high school I had been informed and really taken action on eliminating my carbon footprint I really think that I could have made a change. I grew up in a very tiny town, and frankly a lot of people don’t get to leave that tiny town. They don’t get the access to an education that I have been exposed to. They aren’t surrounded by people who are driven and willing to give something that they believe in. I think that my high school self could have shown through example and advocated for what I was doing. Looking back, I still think that I can make a change and stand up for what I believe in with the hopes of taking it back to my hometown and teaching people about what is going on in our beloved planet and the steps that we need to make a change. 
         <br><br>
         So yes, I think that we need to become the vanguards of the future. We need to be the change that we wish to see in the world. If we want something to happen, we can’t just sit around and wait for change to take place. If we wait around no one will take action. There will be no drive or incentive to switch to public transport so the infrastructure will not be put into place. There will be not carbon tax and the fossil fuels companies will keep putting CO2 into the atmosphere until there is not more. What I am saying is WE need to act, and WE need to act now. If we act than they (friends, family, politicians, companies) will act to do what’s right.

I feel the same way. I thought I was environmentally friendly before I got to UCSB, but I was wrong. I had the power to make a difference and leave an impact, but I simply wasn't educated enough. I believe that if everyone in high school had to attend a class like this, it would change society. Too many people believe they are environmentally conscious, without having any basis for what makes up the complex issue of climate change. Young kids need to be taught that their actions have consequences and that they are responsible for stopping climate change. I believe that the time for all of this is now. We cannot wait for everyone to come around and accept how disastrous climate change has become. Young people have to be the revolution and set an example for those older. It is not radical to demand change. It is not unreasonable to demand action and policy change. As young adults we must inspire change in our families, in our communities, and in our world. We simply don’t have time left to wait.


<br><hr>
I agree with you completely.  Though I was never able to take AP Environmental Science, I would still classify myself as environmentally concerned.  While in primary school, I biked everywhere and was willing to walk when biking was unavailable.   I remember being a part of the Environmentally Concerned Kids club in middle school and helping set up both compost and recycling.  
         <br><br>


Now when I look back on that, I realize how little I was truly doing.  Sure, recycling was important, but there was a ton of food getting thrown away or wasted every day.  By the time I reached high school, I started driving to school rather than biking.  If I had known how detrimental these activities were, I could have tried harder to mitigate my footprint.  Though I now know and will do what I can, the main issue is that most people will never know.  

         <br><br>

What we need can be called a vanguard if you wish, but it can also be called being proactive.  If we are able to implement climate based education in elementary and middle schools, that could help create a "vanguard" of youth who will be able to cause a beneficial change.
<br><hr>
I definitely share the same shock as you from the lack of knowledge I had on climate change during high school. Many high schoolers are motivated to dedicate hours of community service and volunteer work to helping others and the environment. I’m not disregarding their work at all when I say this, but it is a pity that most of them (including me) were not aware of the bigger issues with climate change. 
         <br><br>


As you said, recycling is just one part of helping the environment, but there’s so much more we didn’t learn about. I feel that if those many hours could be spent on both educating themselves and educating others about climate change issues, and then acting upon them (promoting the right politicians, diet changes, and more efficient public transportation), their impact would be felt by many.

         <br><br>

I completely agree with your last statement - it’s our job to take action, and in some ways, it’s our responsibility to make sure the other people in our lives follow our example.

<br><hr>
I very much agree with you when you talk about not being that educated on topics like that. I, too thought I was environmentally friendly and knew all about recycling and reducing waste until I found out the immense weight it has on our environment. I never realized as a child and teen that all the food students don't eat during school get thrown out.... every day. Even here at UCSB, all the food in the dining commons gets wasted every single day and it just gets thrown out and it's sad because it could've gone to a homeless shelter or those in need but it doesn't. 

         <br><br>

I also wanted to point out how impractical it almost is waiting for people to act. I agree with you 100% that we need to act now. Ken talks about politics and how it starts with them. It's up to those in power to change our laws thus, promoting and executing a carbon tax. However, I do not believe that congressmen/women, state senators, mayors, etc. will promote that because they essentially want to be re-elected and if they propose something concerning our climate and environment, they're scared to lose voters thus losing their power and out of office. It's just a power game to them. And it makes me sad that we have to rely on those who don't support it. I do want to act now, but if it doesn't start with them, the environment and planet are already dead.

I was able to relate to you as having been part of AP Environmental Science in high school, environmental science class in middle school, ENGL 22, ENGL 23, and was a part of a team of individuals at my high school in charge of recycling since our school didn’t do it themselves. Recycling was always pushed at the forefront as it was one of the simplest things we can offer to do. You bring up food as well, which is incorporated into recycling as early as elementary school we were taught about composting. This lecture really zones in on the importance of education, repeated emphasis on these things so it becomes ingrained into us as “normal” almost. Vanguards of the future. While this is an interesting choice in terms of label as a role or position, it does it’s job in describing what should be expected of us and what we should do further down this road. A key point is that if we keep thinking our one little change does not do much, then if everyone thought this, then we will never get anywhere with no action. One person is just as important, as it adds up. By bringing up our awareness in classrooms repeatedly, this will make the biggest difference as we will be born into this new mindset, giving us the right set of knowledge and hope to motivate us to take the steps to make change. The people you are surrounded with are a huge influence on this as well. We’ve previously explored the differences between being born into a “culture” versus growing up through changes in cultures, which could range from a broad array of things including spending habits and environmental ideals, proving how environment and background factor in. Us being born into this generation where youth movements are of the essence, every generation following us should be better equipped than the next with information and solution technologies to make our planet better. And this is why we are handed the baton to being the vanguards of the future, which will be shared with our future generations to carry on as well.

It is almost frustrating to hear that so many people have had the same experience. We have been taught that we need to recycle and that riding a bike is good for the environment. However we are really taught about the drastic affect that certain things can have on our environment such as how much CO2 is really put in the atmosphere by driving to school everyday. An Issue that I think is really hard for high schoolers to wrap their heads around is the standing out. For me biking was kind of seen as a nerdy thing at my school, there for no one rode their bike to school. If it would have been addressed multiple times how import for the environment it is to ride your bike I am sure that it would have changed form something that was see as weird or strange to a really cool thing that people were doing because they cared about the world that they lived in. I think this goes for most thing; food, water, transportation. Education is key and we need more education in our school systems so that people who are interested and passionate can be the ones to change.

Yeah, I agree. The short answer is that we do need a climate vanguard. Rarely has the government ever made any progressive changes on there own. There has always been a small group of people who started questioning the injustice of the laws in place, once the word spreads, more people get involved to the point where it is literally impossible for the government to ignore the sounds of their screams. Take, for instance, the Civil Rights movement and the Bracero Movement, both of these and others may have started as smaller ones or maybe weren’t given the attention necessary but once a “vanguard” started leading the way, then the movements were able to reap some real change. We do have an Environmental Movement happening, but of course, we need to make a little more noise if you will, and for that, we will need a group of people willing to pave the ways for others. We can only make big changes to our economic system if we have a loud enough voice, and a climate vanguard could show us how.




<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. I grew up in a small republican town. My school didn’t even have any environmental classes and whenever climate change was brought up my teachers would immediacy shut you down. I remember having a full blown argument with my psychology teacher about climate change because he told me it wasn’t real. (I am also not one to argue, im usually very quiet but it just made me so mad) So being that I grew up around a lot of people who didn’t believe in climate change I think we can’t just wait for other people to start changing there ways because honestly I don’t think they will. We need to start making a change now and have others follow in our footsteps. Our generations need to be the leaders and show all the other generations behind us AND show the generations ahead that this is real!! So many people have the “out of sight out of mind” mentality when it comes to climate change which is so bad because before they know it it’s going to be to late and there will be no reviving the planet. So I believe we need to be changing our ways now and not waiting for others to jump on board.

I was also amazed by how much I have learned in this class about the climate crisis that I had never even heard of before. I was told that the best way to combat climate change was to recycle, get an electric car, and turn off the lights when I wasn't using them. I tried my best to follow these things and thought that by doing so I was being environmentally conscious. Yet I know now that these actions are not nearly as beneficial to the planet compared to other strategies, for example switching to a plant-based diet. I can't believe how few people are informed about ways that individuals can help combat this climate crisis. If individuals are informed, hopefully, many can be inspired to take action to help the planet. To enact effective change, however, this needs to happen on a large scale. 
         <br><br>
This is why I think it is important to have a climate vanguard. Having people leading the charge and taking these first steps could help inspire and educate others who don't know much about how to combat the climate crisis, but may wish to fight for our planet. Change happens slowly, and we can't afford to wait until it is too late to act. By having a group of people be an example and a way to educate others on how to live a life with a smaller carbon footprint, we can slowly shift the tide and get more people to join the fight against the climate crisis before it is too late.

I share many of the same general thoughts that you had regarding becoming climate vanguards. Similarly, I also took APES in high school and during my senior year I volunteered locally among other things in the name of climate activism. However, selfishly until last quarter, all those efforts by me had stopped due to distractions from coming into my first year of college. I think that my situation reflects many wherein they care about the environment and make a small effort into becoming vanguards, but those efforts are put onto the wayside if anything more "important" comes up in their personal life. It's just part of human nature to put more attention to yourself than the environment around us. A lot of people grow up without having a care in the world regarding the environment. It just never comes up and even when it does the effects are inherent to this time delay that Ken touched on before. Therefore, without proper education and individual effort the world will never truly evolve for the better, rather it will dissolve into a dystopia due to our wasteful consumption of the world's resources. So if anyone truly cares for the environment, they must address how willing they are to change for the better of it. How much longer will we be able to appreciate the beauty of the world until we ourselves destroy it? So yes, I agree, we do need to act now.



<br><hr>
I heavily agree with the fact that the lack of education within our high school experience is one of the key factors of us being unaware of how our actions are affecting the planet. Another factor that I experienced too with you is the problem of being part of a very small town where issues like climate change do not get spread around so easily. I have always recycled, have always been taught that oil companies are the #1 polluters in the world, have always been taught that oil spills are the reason why our oceans are polluted (even though I just learned in THIS CLASS that ocean acidification is actually a thing that is causing more damage than oil spills), have always been taught to reuse, reduce, and recycle, yet this college course only has taught me SO MUCH MORE about MY PLANET than ANY SCIENCE COURSE IN MY HIGH SCHOOL IN THE LAST 4 YEARS!
         <br><br>


To be a vanguard for the future, we have to make sure that one of our steps to succeed is by making sure that the education system WILL teach it's students the problems of climate change and the things they can do to stop it. Education is one of the main ways for us to know the problems that we are causing. If the author/publisher of "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" can pitch their argument to teachers and make sure that schools either agree to their idea or just not include the subject at all, then let's play the same card and prompt the situation to teachers and the education systems. By acting, either big or small, on the situation at hand, we will be making a difference. And I feel like the best place to start is within the education system, especially if many of us now are lacking the knowledge of how much planes are adding carbon to our atmosphere, of how the fashion industry is one of the main reasons as to why there is so much waste on our earth, and of how we can lower our carbon footprint by just simply using mass transportation systems.

I agree with you. I think one of the hardest things to try and explaining to people is the impact that eating meat has on the environment. Food is a large cultural aspect of many people's lives, whether it be religion or family traditions, each person is raised on a certain diet which can be difficult to change. I stopped eating red meat about 7 years ago and even though one person can't completely change the supply curve, they can start a trend. In California, many more restaurants are popping up that are vegetarian or vegan making the shift to eating less meat easier from a cultural standpoint. However, not every state or country is at that point in the move towards less meat supply. 

         <br><br>

I also remember growing up and being challenge to clear my plate of food, and it shocks me how much food is wasted in our country. Not only are there many countries in the world that don't have the supply of food that the United States does, but all of this excess food is being produced and emitting it's carbon footprint, and is just being wasted because it is too much or it isn't perfect. If we want to start making an impact on the amount of carbon in the atmosphere we have to start looking at the food that we don't' consume. Just like Ken has stated, the biggest thing we can do is change the way we eat. Agriculture is one of the leading causes of the climate crisis, and while many environmental groups don't focus on that aspect, its important and what we can do to help, is bring the demand for meat down, forcing the meat industry to decrease their supply substantially.

I 100% agree with you!!! In high school I was always known as the eco-friendly girl who carried around her reusable water bottle, thrift-shopped, and pushed recycling on everyone. But the complete shock I received when I left for college was insane. How could I have not known how little I was actually doing? Since taking multiple environmental studies classes here at UCSB, I really feel like a slacker compared to everyone else. We are the generation that’s supposed to change everything, but how are we supposed to do that when we need to get everybody on board. Our generation will be the one to lead the fight against climate change and hopefully when others see our actions, they too will join in.



<br><hr>

I 100% agree with your comment. As the weeks go by as I take this class, it amazes me how poorly I have been informed of climate change growing up. Growing up, I too kept on hearing about why everybody needs to “reduce, reuse, and recycle.” In addition, I also heard about the importance of turning off the lights when they are not needed and turning off the faucet while you brush your teeth and wash your hands. However, these were some of the only things that I have heard about solutions to climate change. However, as I grow older and become more mature and educated on this matter, I realize that I do not nearly know enough about climate change. However, this is partially not my fault. Why do schools and the government not address the importance of eating a sustainable diet? Why is this the first time that I have heard that “eating a hamburger is equivalent for showering for two months?” Although I recognize that I should have taken matters into my own hands and should have done research on this topic by myself, I stand by the fact that schools and the government need to wake up and realize that they have the means necessary to help change our climate for the better by spreading awareness about issues such as animal agriculture.

Your comment is very interesting. I belive that we were led and brainwashed to believe certain things were the cause of climate change. I also to AP Environmental Science. The textbook and coursework seemed as if it was from 1980's. It did not have any of what we are learning about in Climate Crisis. The huge corporations that are secretly controlling what we learn in the classroom do not want us to think about. The huge corporations do not want us to think that it is flying, eating meat, buying cars to be the problem. 

         <br><br>

It is also these things that people do not want to do. It is easy to just recycle. Instead of the trash you just put it into a different crate. Easy right? too good to be true. The problem is deeper than what can you put your plastic into. This is the problem. People need to make the actual change to their lifestyle. Eat vegan, dont fly, these are not as easy recycling, but needs to be done.



<br><hr>
In high school, I had only a fraction of knowledge that i know today about the climate crisis and greenhouse emissions. Most of that knowledge came from what i learned in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL about how we should recycle may things, properly dispose of oil and conserve water from our local county mascot, Mr.Funnel head. I learned everything about environmental impact from once a year presentations done by the Contra Costa County Clean Water Program (shout out to y'all for giving me free pencils and knowledge of proper recycling habits when my school district refused to.) When i think about it, this is really upsetting because it feels like we are being molded to think a certain was from our childhood. Climate issues became second knowledge to a lot of people in my generations,  masked by the vast knowledge we learn in school of how to multiply mixed fractions and the importance Columbus day (I say this sarcastically.) Lucky for me, I listened to Mr.Funnel head and properly dispose my oils, batteries and sorted out Trash, but I wish i knew more about climate-change at a younger age because i feel like i could of done more. People made fun of me when they see me struggling to find a recycling bin, but I will always remember what Mr.Funnel head told me: "We are Earths Heroes." If we change the mentality of our generation and the next, then we can have more "climate vanguards." We are doing what we can to SAVE the planet and this is the mentality we need right now. Don't doubt yourself and be inspired by changes you are doing to your life, like eating less meat or biking to school, because eventually somewhere along the line you might inspire another person to do the same. After all, if i was inspired by a giant funnel wearing green tights, imagine what you can do.

I also took AP Environmental Science and had believed my knowledge was sufficient enough to make a change, as my instructor was very thorough and passionate about environmental issues. Ever since coming to UCSB, though, I feel like I have just barely scraped the surface of the climate crisis. I feel like I've been living my life very ignorantly, and that even with my attempts to cut down my carbon footprint in high school, I have not done enough as I could have when I was exposed to environmental issues as early as my freshman year of high school. We really do need a climate vanguard, and we need to have taken action way long ago. Our voices may sometimes be drowned out and overpowered by those who don't believe that this is a crisis, but we just need to overpower them as well and have them see that the world is falling down around us.




<br><hr>

I have a strongly similar story as you. I am from a very small town where the climate crisis wasn't really talked about. I recycled and used a reusable water bottle so I thought I was progressive. I had no idea what I needed to be doing because no one every taught me as a child. I wish I would have known then what I know now. I believe the reality of my carbon footprint would be very different now. I remember going out to dinner and my entire family would get a steak that no one would finish (it's much different now) their food. I have been to countless restaurants that over-serve or my family will order appetizers to "have a little bit of everything" but we have always taken our leftovers home. My mom will cook dinner and then we will save the leftovers. It's a terrifying thought that we can't fully control that in college until we have our own kitchens. 
         <br><br>

The environmental education I have gained at UCSB, mostly from Ken, has been life changing. A Climate Crisis 101 class should be taught in every elementary or high school. There should be an effort to educate children when they are young in order to save our planet. I am still shocked how uneducated I was for the first 18 years of my life and I am sure there are so many kids out there that are in the position. If every child in the United States was at least aware of anthropogenic climate change I believe we could start to work towards real goals for the planet.

I find your comment to be really interesting. I also took AP Environmental Science in high school, but had a different experience. I remember my teacher showing us documentaries often, one of them being Cowspiracy, and teaching us a lot beyond the basic curriculum of the course. She was one of the best teachers I had in high school, and I never considered that other students did not have the same experience in that class. I completely agree with you that lack of education on environmentalism is a major part of the issue. I remember being in Ken's class last quarter and watching the True Cost documentary, which was one of the most eye-opening moments of the course for me, and realizing the problems behind fast fashion for the first time. It always shocks me how much information I am completely ignorant to, even on a topic that I would consider myself passionate about. One of the major problems, I think, is that many of the people who are the most ignorant to the facts of climate change are the least likely to go out of their way to learn more about it. I was so excited to take APES in high school, and looked forward to taking Ken's courses because I'm already passionate about the environment. However, I can't help but think of all of the people that should be in this course as well, but aren't. When I see all of the little things that can be done, such as taking a charger out when its not in use, I wish that everyone could be made aware. I wonder what the difference on our planet would be if people that choose to remain ignorant would get over themselves and start helping, even in small ways. Your ending statement is so impactful, and I agree entirely. Without incentives, I feel like people will stay in denial of climate change and nothing will get done, sadly.



<br><hr>

I agree with your statement, I always thought I was environmentally conscious, as I always made sure to recycle and switch off the lights if not needed. Until this class, I wasn't aware that what I was doing was contributing basically nothing. In elementary to high school, they only emphasized that the most important thing we could do was to recycle. I feel that they should teach much more, including the detrimental consequences if we do not make the changes.  It does not take much time out of the day and I feel that exposing the new generations to this issue would make a great impact on the current crisis. I realize that the only thing I can truly do is to make sure I tell my family members to vote for someone who is green into power. 
         <br><br>
On the note of flying, I am not sure if it is possible for most people to stop this activity completely. As most of my family is international and located in Taiwan, they fly here to visit their children and other family but they are busy people. My aunt is a neurologist and her son is in med school, neither have the time to slow travel or not fly across international waters. They have busy lifestyles and can not afford that time off but I cannot ask a mother to not see her son for four years. Seeing each other over skype or other video apps is simply not the same as seeing each either in person.  It's ethical to stop flying for vacations or business meeting but I feel that stopping flying completely is not very realistic.



<br><hr>

I definitely feel the same way. My whole life I have thought that I have been environmentally friendly by doing little things like picking up trash, etc. I had no idea cars, for example, used up so much CO2. Throughout my high school and the surrounding ones in my town, there are very few environment classes you can take in order to get better educated on this issue. This is shocking to me because not just shows how selfish humans can be by not being able to give a basic background on climate change and how it really works.
         <br><br>

I think its severely important that we become vanguards of the future. We need to be the ones to step up against older generations who think there is no crisis. We must reduce our carbon footprint down to as much as we can.



<br><hr>
In high school, I learned nothing about the climate crisis. Like other schools in my community the only thing that was taught to us were the impacts of plastic in our oceans and the importance of recycling. For instance, in my own high school and some of the local high schools, the importance of recycling was emphasized by students collecting water bottles and placing recycling bins inside classrooms. But nothing else was done apart from that. It makes me sad to think that in high school I did not know much of what I know today. In reading your comment, I start to think about others and what we are taught in high school. I also start to think about the importance of what is not being taught to us. Why are high school students not learning about the climate crisis? If there are high school students being taught about the climate crisis, how much is actually being taught? I believe that if more high school students were to learn about the things we are learning about, there will be a profound effect on mitigating the climate crisis. Like college students, by learning at the K-12 level, students will begin to ask questions and will be driven to take action. Despite not taking much action in high school, we can always start now. There is no time to waste, our planet needs us. We cannot wait for everyone else.




<br><hr>
It really is surprising how much has gone unbeknownst to so many of us young adults. It's kind of tragically amusing to think about my past self thinking I had done my good, environmentally conscious deed for the day and soon thereafter eat a largely meat based meal.  However, I am here and becoming educated now and am now in a position where I may help guide others on how to live more harmoniously with the ecosystem. 
         <br><br>

One issue that has subverted so much change in the past and now in the present is the power and influence of money. Being personal "vanguards" is all many of us have to offer, but that fact doesn't diminish its significance.  I hope to see more social influencers promote an attractive and well- informed message to their followers about the actions that yield environmental friendliness.




<br><hr>

I agree that we have to lead the charge if we are to have a chance to stop climate change - but the reality is that most people will not act until it's too late. It doesn't matter if all the people in this class chose to cut their emissions down - if the majority of people do not act, then nothing will change. Change is hard to accept and I feel like most people will not care if their actions continue to bring about climate change. In order to stop climate change, we must all be willing to bend to avoid breaking. In other words, we all have to cut our emissions to stop climate change. In order to do this, we have to vote for people and support laws that limit emissions. We must start talking to the people around us and try teaching them about climate change. This is not something we can solve alone - it must be a group effort.



<br><hr>

I agree with you. I feel like many of us have thought recycling had a bigger impact on the environment than it does because of how it was taught to us (as a savior of the earth). Stuff like recycling and renewable energy are promoted so much more instead of some of the bigger solutions to the climate crisis.
         <br><br>
I hope that schools are proactive and start teaching children the issues of climate change and what's chiefly causing it. We mainly just learned about "global warming" in school and how gases are poking holes in our atmosphere, but we weren't really educated on the causers of this problem. If our younger population is adequately educated on these issues, it'll help greatly, as people often have a hard time going against what they were taught/how they were raised. In a society that makes cars seem so cool, I never realized how bad they were for the environment. We need to stop idolizing and promoting the American dream, where big houses and lots of cars are the ideal way of living. Once we get out of this way of thinking, tackling the issues of climate change will be much easier.



<br><hr>

I relate about also being environmentally friendly. I too was in Ap environmental in Highschool and I thought that we could just have solar and wind power to solve our problem with global warming. But once I came to this course, I realize how bad of position we actually are in this world. I ate a lot of burgers and thought that they had nothing to do with climate change, and then I realize cows are one of the most key factors of climate change. I really wish that my high school would also inform the students with more details and information about what is really going on with the environment and climate crisis.

         <br><br>

We do have to act now. It will be hard to get everyone on board but hopefully, we can start soon. If we cannot change our ways soon for the climate crisis, we will see major consequences. And like you said, we can not sit around and watch this happen. We have to get up solve our problem of global warming



<br><hr>

I feel the same way. I also thought I was environmentally friendly before I went to UCSB. I did every garbage sorting and recycled as much plastic and used paper as possible. Turned off the lights every time I left and saved water by shortening the shower time. When I thought I was doing my bit to protect the earth and did way better than people around me, I didn’t know that was far from enough until I took professor Hiltner’s class. Normal daily travels, normal meat diets, and even normal clothing would contribute so much to the global warming. It is a sad truth that no one taught me all this early and I didn’t form good eco-friendly habits in time like taking slow-transportations every day and having a plant-based diet and so on. If I were taught early, I would never act in an environmentally unfriendly way and not like now introspecting and regretting what I’ve done. I cannot emphasize the importance of having a climate vanguard too much. Even though the behaviors of the older generation and part of my generation are hard to change, we need to educate the new generation right in time. Only when the education and leadership are in place can people really take action, and the resolving of climate crisis would be reachable.



<br><hr>

I agree with you on how you said that as each lecture goes on, the more you learn about how uneducated you were prior to listening to these lecture videos. Personally, I have not eaten meat since the age of 8. I thought that this would be beneficial to the world as a whole but of course it requires an effort from a large amount of the population. I believe that if high school students were required to take a course on the global climate crisis, we would stand a higher chance to help improve the damage that is occurring to this day. 
         <br><br>
If there would be a "vanguard" for the climate crisis, I believe that they would have to be an individual that has lots of political power. For example, politicians have such a great following and are able to rally individuals to believe in a certain action. If they were to promote our climate crisis, people around the country would be a lot more educated and feel the need to make an impact.


<br><hr>
I can definitely relate to how little I knew about the climate crisis before this class as well. I thought that recycling and the fact that my mom drove a Prius meant we were reducing our carbon footprint efficiently. I also agree that we have to make changes ourselves. If we don't practice what we preach nobody will listen and nothing will change. I also agree that cultural change will slowly happen if many individuals decide to be responsible for their actions and work on being sustainable themselves.

Today, I went on a field trip with my writing class (shoutout to Professor Chris Dean) to the North Campus Open Space (NCOS)-- I know, very K-12. We explored the restoration project’s grounds and learned about climate change with our guide, Lisa Stratton, lecturer and UCSB’s Director of Ecosystem Management. Not only did Dr. Stratton teach us a lot about Santa Barbara’s efforts to combat climate change (which I will mention later in my comment), but we were also able to get a feel of how many people are actually aware of the consequences of anthropogenic climate change. As expected, my class- people of the younger generation- shared a pretty adequate amount of prior knowledge regarding the topic.

         <br><br>

Dr. Stratton touched on how we, as a society, are known to make irrational, unpredictable (and questionable) choices. For example, tons of Lime Scooters and HOPR bikes (common modes of transport to and from campus) end up in bizarre places, like the UCSB Lagoon, or even washed up on beach’s shores. This, in turn, dramatically shortens the machines’ life spans. What we don’t know (or, I guess, what we know now after Ken’s lecture video on cars) is the cost to the environment that it actually takes to manufacture these “eco-friendly” machines as a ratio to their life spans. It doesn’t compensate for, as an example, car-use. It just isn’t enough to combat the climate crisis.
         <br><br>


Also, I think it’s great that professors have begun to implement modern topics such as climate change into their lectures and assignments. What’s better is that UCSB even offers courses about the topic to students, such as ENGL22 and ENGL23, regardless of your major.

         <br><br>

Anyway... do we really need a climate vanguard?

         <br><br>

Honestly, I feel like “climate vanguard” is a bit of an alarmist title. Not only that, but labeling yourself as a part of it just sounds tacky. Tying back to what Dr. Stratton mentioned, we are inherently irrational. There is no real way to gauge how people will make use of environmentally-friendly resources. I don’t think we need a “climate vanguard” per se, we just need to learn how to effectively inform the masses of the detriments that the climate crisis has already caused.

I completely agree with your statement that we need to learn how to effectively inform the masses of the severe consequences that have and are occurring due to climate change. However, I also  believe that along with this, we need to teach the masses, especially today's youth and future generations how to live sustainable so that it becomes the normal way of life. Just like how Ken mentioned that Jonathan Safran Foer stated that "it can begin at the breakfast table" it is up to us to teach our family now, and children of the future how we can change our lives to live in a more Eco-friendly way. Whether it be composting, flying less or not at all, taking advantage of mass-transportation, eating a largely plant-based diet, or all of the above and more we need to make these practices part of everyday life for the average american and that begins with climate change education from a young age. While "climate vanguard" may be a bit of an alarmist title, as you stated, I think the meaning behind it-- that we must act now rather than wait for the rest of the world is completely valid, because if we just sit and wait for the rest of the United States and the world to get on board with making systemic, sustainable changes, we'll probably be waiting forever.

It is true that actually more and more people are now caring more about the climate problem and are thinking about how to address the issues. And it is touching that especially the younger generations are the group really taking action to tackle the crisis. 

         <br><br>

I enjoy hearing when people are sharing their opinions and feelings about how they think about the issues and what they think they can do to help the planet a little bit. Every Time in class it is amazing that younger generation have adequate amount of knowledge about the issue and they all have unique thought and independent thinking, so it makes me think that as long as we all do the same thing, the power we have through connecting each other will for sure help to make a great change to the climate crisis.

         <br><br>

And yes, UCSB is such an amazing school not just having students have awareness about the crisis but many of them are actually starting to do something for a change. The class that we are are taking right now and the class Eng22 I took last year are all amazing classes which gave me a chance to have a deeper understanding of the climate problems and to learn how I can turn my knowledge I have and things I learnt into actions.

I agree with a number of things you said, the most important being how we need to educate people on the effect their actions have on the environment. Inherently irrational actions, as you mentioned in your comment, also have a large effect on the environment. When people choose to throw those bikes and scooters into the water, they are not really thinking about the consequences of their actions, because a lot of the times, it won’t come to directly affect them. However, it ruins the machines that are supposed to help our environment, offsetting their cost of manufacture to their life span ratio. Of course, no one is thinking this as they throw the bikes into the water, they’re thinking haha this is funny. I think to fix this, people would have to be educated into thinking about the consequences of their actions. Learning about climate change would not be enough, you would have to teach people about thinking about their every action and considering all the consequences that come with it before proceeding with their action.
         <br><br>
 Regarding the topic of “climate vanguards” I also find the phrase to be slightly tacky. I understand the sentiment behind the phrase, but in my opinion, individual climate vanguards won’t be able to make a large enough impact to make a difference. I admire the sentiment, and I have also been trying to incorporate various ways to make my lifestyle more eco-friendly, but I don’t think much will change through climate vanguards. Instead, I think it is more important to try to get everyone onboard, especially those in power. I think action through legislation is something that is very necessary in order to make an impact. It is impossible for us to change the world unless we all work together to do it.
<br><hr>
We need to begin now to have sweeping climate action. Wait for the rest of the world to come on board. We don’t have that type of timelines. I start working towards the future. The future is going to be like what you need to prepare for. I need to stop the ample savings of beef. We can get nutritional value elsewhere, and most cultures aren’t meet centered and less it is showing income.
         <br><br>
Interestingly, Denmark is starting a climate Lambo campaign to become totally carbon neutral. We can take the bull by the horns and address the kind of crisis, which is a hugely empowering right. This is a part of our lives that can have a significant impact and affect a lot of what is going on in the climate crisis. It’s also cheaper to go crematorium because you’ll be illuminating beef for the most part. Can do the great job you’re going to expect the future and giving us information on how we could affect change in our own lives.

<br><hr>
I agree that calling oneself a part of the 'climate vanguard' is a bit of a gaudy title, however I also agree that informing the general population about the already widespread consequences of the climate crisis is the most important way to address these changes to our environment. The label may be overkill, but the premises for which a person should stand for as a part of that collective group are inherently beneficial for the planet. 

         <br><br>

As far as the topics that were discussed on your field trip, I think it’s important to not forget about who makes up the general population of UCSB. As a group of folks primarily aged 18-21, it can be assumed that brain development isn’t complete, especially not in the frontal cortex (impulse control, planning, working memory). This in no way excuses nor necessarily explains why, in this specific example, many Lime scooters have wound up in odd places, but does provide good context for the situation. 
         <br><br>


This makes me wonder further about how our generation is responding to the threat of the climate crisis; do we not know enough to be making better decisions for our planet, or does the information that we do have not genuinely permeate our actions? Or, worse even, do we know and just not really care? Humans are inherently unpredictable, but our actions are also known to be influenced by our own beliefs. So, not only do we need to educate folks about what’s going on, but we must instill a certain belief in people - enough so to incite real changes in behavior.

<br><hr>

I agree with your comment that it isn’t necessarily a Vanguard that we need to be forming to spread awareness of climate change and the havoc it’s wreaking across the world. I think that this subject that Ken discusses in his lecture video heavily relates to my first comment on the reading he had us do, Project Dawn. While legislation and individual efforts are both important, it starts with the mindset that most people have in this country and all around the world. “What I do today won’t make a difference.” This is the kind of thinking that has prolonged and fueled this problem for decades. Is it necessary to form a vanguard? No. But do we need examples of what we can do to fix the climate problems we’ve created. Yes. And again, it starts with the mindset that people have been fixated on their entire lives. The last thing we need is some sort of revolution to further divide people across the world on such an important issue of climate change. Instead we need evolution. Don’t just say that we need to stop using fossil fuels and threaten millions of working class peoples’ jobs, create an idea or replacement for using such environmentally dangerous materials like oil and coal and create new jobs to replace those ones that we’re trying to get rid of. It’s true that it isn’t just individual changes that need to be made. We need legislation that targets the biggest producers of fossil fuels and other harmful materials that literally destroy our world. But we need legislation that tries to work for the majority of people, if not everyone. This is where my example about coal workers or other fossil fuel industry jobs comes in. We can’t just throw around the idea of getting rid of millions of jobs without having a replacement system that won’t screw over millions of working class people. Even looking at something like a carbon tax sounds like a great idea, but even that hasn’t been fully unraveled. We want to hurt the big fossil fuel companies and interests, but we need to do it without hurting our economy and its millions of workers and contributors and even just everyday average Americans. We also need something that appeals to less radical people or those who aren’t completely sold on ideas that help the climate crisis, like renewable energy sources or other similar ideas. If a lot of Americans and others around the world don’t believe as deeply in the climate crisis, even if it is factual and sound, we can’t scare off these people with super radical ideas. I’m not saying that all of the ideas mentioned are radical, just that it is important to appeal to as large of an audience as possible without making them feel horrible or intimidated by ideas put forth.

I find it really interesting how you say we don't need a climate vanguard, but that we do need to spread climate awareness to the masses.  I think I would disagree only because I define and view what it means to be a climate vanguard differently.  To teach and to spread climate awareness to the masses is what I would consider acting as a climate vanguard.  In fact, I would call Professor Ken  as a climate vanguard as he teaches his students to actively fight against the climate crisis.  Being a climate vanguard would not necessarily mean devoting one's life to environmentalism, but simply setting a trend or leading your own way for living a more environmentally friendly lifestyle.  To be a leader could just mean to go against the tide against the culturally accepted lifestyle that consumerism and corporations set for you, and the fact that others may follow is in the hindsight.  Being the architect to your own future is enough to have a lasting impact on the environment, and others will learn best from your actions rather than from the text.
<br><hr>
YES, that experience sounds awesome, and I love how many similar opportunities there are across campus. I've recently gotten invites to share poetry on climate issues, to get involved in campus environmental activism, and to community gardens... UCSB Reads selected a book that focuses on climate change this year, and there are a half a dozen classes that I've seen address the climate crisis in some capacity.

         <br><br>

I do think vanguard is tacky, and... I don't know if alarmist is the word I would use? But I certainly didn't escape the militant connotations noted above, and I think there could be better language used to describe this idea, especially since I think group-think or elitism in this area is dangerous... For example, while I really like creative work that defines new form and style, I really dislike work that's explicitly labelled as avant-garde. It feel pretentious to me to explicitly label your work as being innovative and original, I think that this is either apparent in work, or it isn't. In the same way I think it might be more effective to work without a label here. It's been my experience that one of the most difficult things about climate conscious eating is the social expectation  that people who choose to alter their diets for ethical reasons are going to be prissy and lord it over everyone else... I think the less this stereotype is reinforced, the better.

<br><hr>
Thank you for sharing your experience with your writing class! I knew the Hoper bikes were ending up in weird places, but I didn’t even really think about the impact on the environment. I agree that that “climate vanguard” does sound a bit alarmist and tacky, and I personally would cringed if I heard such a thing. However, I do think there should be a more organized group of leaders who do start figuring out viable alternatives now, so when everyone is ready to get on board, it would be an easier transition. I think the reason a lot of people are not taking any sort of action to stop climate change is because it’s hard. It’s hard to take public transportation, especially if it’s undependable and inconsistent. If there was an organized place to share your experiences/ideas (similar to Subtle Asian Traits) where everyone can easily connect, it would be much easier to see what works and doesn’t work. A slight problem I had with Hiltner’s lecture on air travel was his alternatives weren’t realistic or reasonable for people to actually do (like the six day destination trip). Therefore, we should begin acting now, so it’s easier later like studying for a class! It’s easier to study consistently, instead of all at once the day before the exam. It’ll be easier to make these lifestyle changes with the knowledge we develop now rather than figuring things out under stressful times.

Reminiscing about my junior year in high school, we also went on a field trip to learn the topics about the climate crisis with my environmental science class. We went ashore to see the current situation and had a comparison with the picture of the same place that was taken several years ago. We observed that due to the sea level rise and high temperature, the place is different from several years ago. Therefore, I have kind of a similar thought with you that you have mentioned in your first three paragraphs. Only if we actually see the picture by ourselves, we can truly know how worth the situation was right now. If we only hear about or look at some current news about climate change, we might not get that feeling. Undoubtedly, we need to take action immediately and have an awareness of urging others to do so. Refer back to the topic “climate vanguard”, I think if someone truly suggests others, or urge others to continuously take actions, he can be considered as a “vanguard”. If more and more people have this sense of awareness, more and more people will take action.

Is no one going to talk about the fact that he specifically uses the term "vanguard"? Maybe I'm far too online and far too leftie, but the only times I know of where there is a political movement referred to specifically as a "vanguard" is... er... Marxism-Leninism. You know, unironic Bolshevism. And this continues to make me increasingly confused about the point and ideology of this class, because there really is a contradiction in almost all of these videos between true systemic radicalism and liberal individualism. On one hand, you have revolutionary potential and the collective overthrow of things-as-they-are; on the other hand, you have changes in individual behavior that hope to influence hearts and minds and work from there. These two ideologies are... honestly not very compatible, almost irreconcilable, yet I think Ken here is trying to synthesize them both into something more palatable for both. I'm not sure that it's working. 
<br><br>
A few videos ago, I commented something similar on the no-waste videos that used the substance of socialism and radicalism-- we cannot have an endless growth economy, capitalism is literally killing us, we have to take on our economic system if we want change-- but cloaked it in liberal rhetoric that made it seem conflict-averse, like changing our entire economic system could be done through individual effort and not collective change. This video, on the other hand, is the opposite, using terms so very left-coded like "Vanguard" and using them to describe how we should all individually be eating less meat. From what I can tell, Ken does believe that we need to overhaul our economic system, but also genuinely thinks it can be done through talking to our parents and changing our consumer habits. 
<br><br>

I... well, I think that's a little naive, myself. You can't really have it both ways. Yes, we do need to be eating less meat-- I'm doing so myself, I'm trying to get my friends to do the same-- but we CANNOT win if all we're doing is changing our own behavior. People buy meat because it's easy. People take planes because it's easy. It's time-consuming and difficult and obnoxious to be environmentally sustainable as long as our systems and economies are structured as they are right now. If you want to stop people from eating meat, you really do have to legislate an end to agricultural subsidies. And you cannot do that individually. You have to do that together. 
<br><br>

If our goal is to feel better about ourselves, a 'vanguard' is a group who goes ZeroWaste and vegan. If our goal is to save the world... well, let's just say the vanguard's going to have to do a lot more than that. Solidarity Forever, I guess.

I agree that this class can almost appear to manipulate messages. Should I be putting my energy into individual changes or should I focused on becoming a revolutionary and leading the fight? I think that what Ken is trying to say is that we need that mindset change. How I am expected to be a part of a radical change to the system, that will require radical changes in my own life, if I cannot change what I eat for breakfast? I think that this is where liberal rhetoric gets folded into the conversation, and I think that this is not Ken's goal. Liberal changes are often minute and categorized by value signaling rather than self sacrifice for the greater struggle.
<br><br>


There is clearly a large difference between eating a plant based diet and not choosing to use a straw if you ask me. Sure, both are an individual choice to do good by the planet. However, I would argue that by eating plant based, and even further, carrying the ethical views of veganism, that one can show solidarity for the planet and for the other beings who live beside them; where as a straw is a relatively meaningless gesture that fetishizes environmentalism for status or personal gain. I am of course not saying that one should use a straw when they have the opportunity to not do so, but I think it needs to be re-evaluated a to why one is not using a straw. Is it because they are zero waste, or is it to jump on this distracting bandwagon of environmental gestures that distract from the bigger more important movement? 
<br><br>


I completely agree that we need one hell of a system overhaul. Capitalism cannot be expected to serve the people or the planet in any sense of the word. I think that a vanguard group is needed to serve as protectors and trailblazers of the movement, but also to inspire those around them. Solidarity forever.

<br><hr>
I was thinking the exact same thing when watching this video. I truly think Ken believes in a complete revolution, while simultaneously encouraging individuals to make small changes. As a college student trying to find ways to make a difference, these conflicting views can be confusing. I am constantly conflicted between believing that fighting the climate crisis requires us to waste less and become vegan, or if we are meant to be protesting for a complete overthrow of the system. I think that fighting the climate crisis requires both, combining individual and societal change. I know that this class has motivated me to go as plastic free as I can, while also introducing me to political candidates and organizations who fight for climate change. While I don’t believe we need to fully overthrow the government, we do need to put pressure on current leaders. We should be voting for new leaders who are motivated to make a difference; we should be protesting; we should be aware of what companies we support. 
 <br><br>

Ken was completely right that many people won’t make a difference unless it is done by law. On top of this, many environmentally friendly solutions conflict with cultural norms. As young people in society, we have to take it upon our ourselves to make a change. We must challenge the idea that eating meat is a sign of affluence or a cultural norm. I think fighting the climate crisis requires us to act uncomfortably, doing what isn’t easy. We have to be the revolution in our own lives and in society, recognizing that climate change is a not a problem that will go away if we ignore it for long enough.

Climate vanguards are influencers. Through social influence, they can get political influence. Yes, we need to vote, and not just to “inspire people”. But remember when Obama tried the cap and trade, but then fossil fuel companies funded groups to attack it, saying it’s “violating our freedom”. I think vanguards could be used to sway public opinion the other way. I agree that just “inspiring other people to change through personal changes” is ineffective, but that’s only when it’s done in isolation without political or economic change. People will often choose the easier path unless forced to change. You could bus to work and try to “inspire” others to do the same, but they’ll choose the easier and faster way: car. You can’t blame them because public transportation is hindered by politicians. That’s why we need to vote for people who’ll support us and force people to change, through things like improving public transportation and enacting a carbon tax. It would make high speed rail, which emits 1/16 CO2 compared to a plane, 1/16 times cheaper than a plane, thus discouraging plane use. It’s always going to be the present, and we have no time to wait for other people to change for us to change, because that’s what other people are doing. We need vanguards, but we can’t just depend on vanguards to inspire others to change. We need vanguards to vote and force other people to change. 

 <br><br>

The obsession with productivity in work has leached into other aspects of our lives. Max output, minimum time with complete disregard for the planet, ourselves, and other people. No time for slow travel, we want to get there now. Our vacations are far too short for that, so we’ll use planes. However, It might not have to be a dyad of “money vs planet” there are ways to save money while helping the planet. For example, we could eschew cars, vote for better public transportation, and save $9k a year. I think we shouldn't turn this into a politically divisive issue and risk losing followers. Anyone and everyone who tries to improve the planet is needed.

<br><hr>

Change in light of the climate crisis should indeed come from the top-down instead of from the bottom-up. So long as there are heavy subsidies for animal agriculture, as you said, meat will be churned out at the existing unsustainable rate and demand will not go down very fast at all. While there are growing alternatives to even hamburgers that are quite palatable, it could take many years for this to catch on. With this in mind, change needs to be affected on the individual level only so far as the individual is a passionate activist. Someone who personally changes their habits without interrupting the harmful habits of others (flying, fracking, etc) is helping, but I don't think that it's helping enough in the long run. 

 <br><br>

This is the problem I have with centrism: there are many cases just like this where you cannot have it both ways. Fighting the deadly inertia of modern life requires some degree of radical change. Simply put, we are in "late-stage capitalism". We have reaped the benefits of the market revolution, and now "everyone "(just a small part of the western world) can enjoy the luxuries of buying stuff as they please, consuming meat daily, and wasting when they feel like it. It's the illusion of wealth without the substance that we have captured. The abundance we find ourselves in is not sublime, it's gaudy. What is especially frustrating is that there are so many people that will try not to 'stir the pot' (looking at you Pete and Biden), but in the end are failing to reach the goals they share with their less centrist counterparts. I see this as an issue partially of postmodernism, i.e. the rejection of any universal narratives and more recently the transformation of that idea into several layers of impenetrable irony we constantly surround ourselves with. We need a return to sincerity. Modern centrism is steeped in cynicism (e.g. South Park). We need a fall back from intense, detached cynicism, and truly get ourselves involved in fighting modern crises like the climate firsthand. Once the first crucial steps against the deadly inertia of eating beef, flying, driving, etc. are taken, it can only get easier. In this way, perhaps individual action can be reconciled with radical change. As I mentioned earlier, activism does start with the individual. So long as individuals stand their ground and express this to the world, perhaps forcefully (force meaning something like a sit-in protest, not violence), there is still hope. 

 <br><br>

Also I think you make an excellent point about how individual choice is merely the first step to widespread radical changes, and how some individual choices can be significant, but others meaningless and showy. I would also put trends like 'meatless monday' and donating to Goodwill into that category. They feel good, but ultimately do not accomplish much good.

<br><hr>
I resonate with the confusion expressed in this thread of comments. Yes, I can eat a largely plant-based diet and buy my clothes from thrift stores and fly as little as possible. I can also encourage others to do the same. But in all honesty I don’t know how significantly those small changes will mitigate the climate crisis. I know this is a cynical mindset that climate activists try to discourage, but as many people in the other comments have said, fossil fuel and agriculture special interests are too powerful to be stopped by individuals not supporting their corporations. The majority of the country would have to stop eating meat and stop flying for a significant change to be made, and I don’t see that happening, at least in the immediate future. Furthermore, as Ken said, eating asparagus in the winter is just as bad for the planet as eating chicken. So even if you are doing your very best to reduce your personal carbon footprint you could be contributing just as much to the climate crisis as the average American. 
 <br><br>

On a more positive note, I do believe that voting and campaigning for elected officials that have the power to make more wide-scale changes is the most important thing we can do. Like Ken said, if flying gets too cost prohibitive, less and less people will continue to do it. I think this is our best shot at getting the majority of the country to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle. The reason so many people live such wasteful lives is because it’s cheaper and more convenient than the sustainable alternative. We need to flip that reality make the sustainable alternative the cheaper and more convenient option.

No one wants to be on the frontline because it's dangerous, yet we still need a climate vanguard. It's hard being the person or part the group to step up and charge forward, but, if you survive, you'd probably get the best benefits and become heroes, just like Rachel Carson or Martin Luther King Jr. 
 <br><br>
For us, the climate crisis isn't at the level of threatening our lives at this very moment. Being part of the climate vanguard might be hard because of the changes you'll have to make, but these changes aren't life-threatening. Why not combat climate change if it only takes  change and won't kill you? Sure, you might get death threats, which is what happens to many of the leading climate scientists and activists, but that's better than being baked to death or kidney failure. Combating climate change won't threaten your survival, but if you don't change, then climate change will literally reduce your happiness and eventually lower your chances of survival. After all, we're pretty much in the sixth extinction event. We're talking about vanguards, but the truth is: everyone is already at the frontline. Climate change is happening right now, and everyone is living on Earth. It's not a matter of who wants to fight climate change, but a matter of realizing that everyone needs to fight climate change. Will you sit passively while being surrounded by danger and rely on others to protect you? Or will you wake up and learn to fight? Currently, there's no real threat to the climate vanguard except for those created by humans, but, in the future, climate change will harm everyone regardless of their choice. As said in the lecture video, people will eventually be forced to change, and it wasn't said what would happen to people who don't change, but I think we have an inkling of what'll happen.
 <br><br>
What each individual can do will vary, but it's possible for everyone to work towards fighting climate change, even if the effects are minimal. The ozone hole was fixed because it was perceived as a threat, but climate change is still treated as fictional or in the future. Vanguards are visionaries and are living in the future because they recognize the threat, while others are still in shock, denial, or despair.
 <br><br>
To me, the term 'vanguard' isn't affiliated with politics, but more of a military term. We should also take note that the definition of vanguard is similar to the definition of a visionary. They're both ahead in terms of thinking.

<br><hr>
Well, I'm glad somebody said it. I have kind of been biting my tongue and attempting to restrain my urge to point out the obvious. But it is true, the only way for this problem to truly get solved is to completely change our economic system. For me, most reform is accounted for in advance by the system; that is, reform is just the cost of preventing systemic change, so of course, it will be paid (like the operating costs of a business)—the question concerns the benefit such change will have.  Audre Lorde, a black feminist poet, once wrote that it’s impossible to dismantle the master’s house using the master’s tools.  For the most part, I agree with this political orientation.  However, I’m also practical.  It’s best not to hedge one’s bets with only one theoretical prediction, because one could always be wrong.  So, while I deeply question the utility of something like institutional reform, I openly support and encourage radical institutional reform in the way of the Scandinavian system.  Ultimately, I know that we need something beyond institutional reform in order to address the magnitude of society’s problems.  I wonder whether radical change is even possible, though; in fact, I really don’t think it is possible.  But I am open to the possibility of being proven wrong, and of course, hope to be proven wrong.   

 <br><br>

I don't see Ken's recommendations of individual contribution as mutually exclusive with radical structural reform. I think it is possible to see notable changes in our climate from individual contributions so I still definitely support everything Ken is doing for this class, but to echo your sentiment, I would definitely prefer to see more radical and top-down approaches brought up.
<br><hr>
I understand your frustration with the ambiguity of individual vs system changes to solve the climate crisis. As individuals who care about the crisis, and want to dedicate themselves to the cause, it can be paralyzing to not know where to devote our energy. Do we focus on our food consumption, our transportation, our consumer habits, our political involvement, our community involvement, our activism, or any one of the countless other aspects of our impact on this planet? We simply cannot do them all. The climate crisis, and socioecological injustice caused by deregulated capitalism as a whole, is an extremely complicated issue, with an array of necessary solutions that stretch across the canvas of our lives. There is no silver bullet. So, when you say that you feel conflicted about whether we need to change the system or our own individual lifestyles, I'm afraid you're looking at it wrong. We need both. They are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are deeply intertwined. The system, our global society, is composed of individuals. It is not some separate entity that controls our lives from a distance. If we only change our individual lifestyles without changing the system, we will not accomplish much because it will just perpetuate the same injustices over time. If we only change the system without changing our individual lifestyles, we will experience a sort of dissonance or dissatisfaction with our societal structure, since we will not have adjusted to the new system. Overthrowing the current petrocapitalist world economic system will be necessary to actually "solving" the crisis. But if this were to happen without allowing individuals to at least begin to change themselves, it would be just as oppressive as the system were working to fix.

“Do we in fact need a climate vanguard?” We absolutely do. The road to change is often paved due to the actions of early adopters. In a tangentially related example, early 2000s consumers of vegan/vegetarian products paved the way for companies such as Beyond to make a move in the market. By showing that there is a real demand, as well as a potential demand, these early adopters paved the way for change. Now, I am not saying that this was a hugely significant change or anything, but it is an analogy to what we can do if we become a climate vanguard. 
 <br><br>

On a different note, I agree with the points Lex brings up about Ken’s specific usage of the word “vanguard.” I find Ken’s usage of the word to be … perplexing. Like Lex says, the only political movement I am aware of which uses the term vanguard is straight out of Leninism. The term vanguard referred to the class-aware sect of the proletariat that drew the proletariat together against their class enemies. However, given Ken’s repeated insistence that violence is not, and cannot be the solution, his usage of the word vanguard is strange. In any case, it is becoming clear that in many ways our system is fundamentally flawed, and needs to be revised. “The revolution will not be televised.”

<br><hr>

What you say is mostly correct. It does seem a little contradictory when Ken tries to place such a large emphasis on individual activism while also stressing that only large sweeping changes can make large and impactful differences. I think the fallacy in this train of thought is the idea that individualistic activism and collective change cannot coexist. It very much can and it very much does today. I see individual activism as one of the first steps that lead to sweeping changes. I am a firm believer in the idea that you have to practice what you preach. Individual activism strongly complements systemic change. Together, the two ideals combine to become greater than the sum of their parts. 
 <br><br>

The power of individual action is derived from its ability to inspire others to action. I don't think individual efforts alone are powerful enough to make difference, but I believe that the individual's ability to inspire does. It's true that a single person simply becoming vegan will not make a sweeping worldwide impact, but it sets an example to be followed. Individual action is important because it is a symbol of a larger cultural change. This is quintessential for a permanent solution to be found.

<br><hr>

Vanguard is indeed a big word. Although I thought I care about the environment, I am not able to fully change my behavior after learning the methods of environmental protection. I can not eat less meat than normal since I am really a meat lover. I can not fully substitute cars with public transportation which is time consuming. The only thing I can do is not to do any other unnecessary things that will bring more distraction to the environment. For example, trying not to have any food waste everyday.

I think what you said has really pointed out the true problem we’re facing. The last few lectures made me fell into a paradox between trying to protect the environment as much as I can by doing what Ken recommended to do and whatever I do the positive impact can be easily offset by just a single flight. The fight with global warming does not just count on individuals. It is understandable that when a person has adapted to a comfortable, convenient life and got used to eat delicious food, he is not so likely to change his habits just to reduce carbon emission by a negligible amount. Maybe some people like Ken are willing to sacrifice their convenience and interest for the environment, and these people are of course honorable. However, this is not the case for most people. Many people can reduce their carbon emission by eating less meat and driving less, but it is barely possible for them to completely change their diet to completely plant-based or their way of going around to completely public transportation. If we really want to make some changes, it must start from our economic system. When there is a law legislated to reduce the consumption of meat and the government spend enough money to promote highspeed railway in order to encourage people to use public transport, that would be the time real change will occur.
<br><hr>
I found your comment super thought provoking and it got me thinking about our course of action as a generation when it comes to tackling this problem. It feels simple to say that if enough of us stop eating meat, then companies will eventually stop producing more. But what good does that do for slowing down climate change in the near future when the public trend of less meat won't catch on for another 20-30 years and economically even longer than that. In that sense, choosing to do things (i.e not eat meat) puts us in a state of living in the future somewhat.
 <br><br>

 I'm just becoming a little, not hopeless, but distraught about how we can make greater systematic changes that encourage everyone to change. Just this past weekend I was trying to explain to my friend the problem with air travel and how we should look for alternatives in this country and he kept throwing in my face "one mode of transportation is incredibly more convenient and easier for me, why the hell would I choose otherwise?!" My point is that trying to push a slow, more gradual change, with an individualistic vanguard approach at times doesn't it will have that much of a "sweeping change" as Ken says is required.

<br><hr>
I definitely see the point made in this comment. I think a lot of us struggle with the individual vs. collective message. While individual change makes sense and will eventually perhaps change entire systems, the truth is that there are so many people that are already working so hard to keep their head above water that making these lifestyle changes for the sake of the environment, something hard to quantify, extremely difficult or even impossible. And I also find it difficult to completely stand behind a carbon tax solution that once again places the onus on the consumer. I’ve attempted to make the changes myself, but if the system doesn’t support me, it makes it very difficult. For example, I eat a vegan diet, but there have been times that I’m at restaurants where there is literally no option on the menu that I can eat. Now I might make my friends or family go to a different restaurant or whatever, but if making the sustainable choice is always the harder route, it’s going to be difficult to stick to these changes.
 <br><br>

That’s why I feel like we do need a vanguard group, but I think they already exist. There are young climate activists who are getting audiences with powerful elected officials, and we have to continue to support them and be outspokenly politically engaged. The number one thing we can do is organize. Join political advocacy groups that are making change happen. Sunrise has non-violently demonstrated in many elected officials’ offices to make them take action on the climate crisis. CALPIRG lobbies elected officials and collects thousands of petitions every quarter to remind elected officials what their constituents actually want. The Environmental Affairs Board works with local actors to create environmental policies and makes our campus more sustainable. 
 <br><br>

And we all have to VOTE. This is the political influence we have, and young people are currently the largest block of voters in the country. But while we’re currently turning out only around 30-40%, 71% over people over 65 are voting in every election. If we vote, we can change the political landscape. Around 80% of our generation believes in climate change, meaning politicians wouldn’t be able to win without accepting the facts because we have the numbers to decide elections. Here at UCSB, we’re in a unique position where we have pretty high voter turnout. Why do you think we see our county supervisor candidates campaigning so much on our campus? Because they cannot win without the Isla Vista vote and they know it. That’s why oil-funded Bruce Porter is trying to greenwash his campaign, because he knows what young people care about. So let’s keep up that trend and vote in every election (our next one: March 3). Solidarity forever.
<br><hr>

I agree with your outlook on the ideas that Ken has pushed these past few weeks. I also believe that the ideals he pushes can be almost counterintuitive but I do not think it is because he is naive of these facts. I believe that Ken is encouraging all these ideals because they are all possible solutions to our problems. Or he may just be listing all these possibilities so that we, the next generation, can decide the best course of action.
 <br><br>

However, I think the main problem that people do not understand is the consequences that can become of these types of actions. Even if a person can somehow manage to completely change our economic system overnight, how would that affect people living now? Yes I am sure this will help the planet but what about the people living now? Would you still have the same ideals about the topic if you knew that these changes have the possibility of negatively affecting billions?
 <br><br>

This is why I believe that the topic of climate change is still a difficult issue to discuss today. Both sides of this topic will have consequences good and bad. This is why I believe that climate change can only be solved from the bottom-up. These types of radical changes take time and a lot of influence. I believe that is why Ken is encouraging a “vanguard” of sorts. So that we can take his ideas and maybe use them to try and create a better tomorrow without hurting a lot of people in the process.

I am conflicted in similar ways to you. I am stuck between wanting to make individual changes, feeling guilty for not making those changes, and then wanting to not make changes at all because if other people are not helping, why should I have to make such concerted efforts? Since becoming educated on environmental issues and taking classes that explain the systemic problems that exist, I have always thought that there needs to be core issues that should be addressed, things that cannot be solved only with the end of the trail choices that we are forced to make due to the systems already in place. Then again, I can compare the climate crisis to other important movements, like civil rights, racism, etc. In these pursuits, I want my actions to reflect my morals and values, such as standing up for others and being a voice against oppressors. The climate crisis does seem to be different in that we are increasingly being asked to change our lifestyles when possible — almost everyday — including what we eat and spend our money on. To me, this is asking a lot of people, particularly those that have less choice on what they can spend their money on. There is a privilege that allows one to eat an organic and plant-based diet, as well as not shopping in the fast fashion business when it is cheap, having access to recycling and composting, and relying on efficient transportation, whether that be by bus or single-passenger cars. Those with plenty of money that are not willing to change their actions to be more environmentally conscious and help others are either lazy, selfish, uneducated, or a combination of those. The obvious example is celebrities or wealthy people taking private jets constantly because this just adds to global carbon emissions, especially when it affects poor people in countries where the luxuries are not taking place. I am not certain what the best way to go about solving these issues is right now, whether it is getting everyone to make certain choices (and whether some people continue to make changes even when not everyone else is), or to get to the root of the problem through local and federal governments. In the end, it probably will be a combination of the two, but I know getting there will be a battle, including the loss of lives, rights, and hope throughout the journey.


<br><hr>
Thank you for expressing what I think many of us in this class has been struggling with since week 1. I absolutely agree that there is a bit of a disconnect between the call for system-wide, overriding solutions and individual lifestyle changes. I understand that systemic change seems scary and the knowledge that that is the only true way to overcome this crisis can be scary to people. But I also think that it is true and we need to focus more on how to achieve such big change. Why aren't we talking about how eating meat is often times cheaper and more accessible to people, and that is also why so many Americans eat SO much meat? Yeah, American portion sizes for meat and the prevalence of it in our cuisines is a cultural trait unseen in many other countries. So what? How are we going to reverse this behavior in our society? This is the part that can turn many people off of trying, as there are many obstacles to social change. Yes, it has to do with the intricacies of our economy and our politics. I get that suggesting we attempt change in those areas seems impossible and daunting to people, especially young college students. But it's a discussion we need to have in greater detail, ESPECIALLY because we are young and numerous and will be the next generation of leaders, Wall Street investors and politicians. So please tell us exactly what we need to do, no matter how complicated or dire. I think we need to know. An example of this is whenever I hear Ken talk about carbon taxes on airplanes or otherwise. Sure, raising the price of air travel would decrease the demand for it. Sure, this would limit its usage to the more affluent members of society. But just in the same way that wealthier countries who pollute the most can afford to "pay off" their emissions while poorer countries can't, this "solution" relies on the mechanisms of inequality made possible by capitalism: which is, in my opinion, not only morally dubious but ignoring a much larger problem that this class needs to address, considering upsets in our economic and political systems seem not far off.

<br><hr>

I didn't really challenge the two options Ken suggested, but after reading your comment, I completely agree with your argument. I know that going zero waste and adopting a plant-based diet would significantly reduce an individual's personal carbon footprint, but I also know that it wouldn't do enough to save the planet.
 <br><br>
I have noticed that this class gives somewhat of a false illusion of how the world is changing. Being in the class for 6 weeks has taught me so much about how people are taking steps to save the environment, and it seems like the entire world is about to change their ways, but I keep forgetting that there are only a little over 850 students who are learning the same thing as me, and only a handful of these 850 students are actually engaged in the issue enough to create drastic change. People are still eating meat, and there are still thousands of cars on the road. The changes Ken recommends can only work for so long before one gets tired of constantly making decisions in favor of the environment. So I agree. A "vanguard" could never bring about impactful change unless if they became globally popular, so I guess we do have to wait for the larger portion of the population to jump on board.

<br><hr>
I really like your comment as it summarizes some of the messages I delivered.
<br><hr>
I don't think making changes individually contradicts waiting the larger population to jump on board. I personally see the belief such as "because me doing it has very minor impact, so there is no point and I won't be doing it until most people jump on board" to be some kind of excuses, or even a sign of comforting oneself from hopelessness and powerlessness. What if everyone have the same mindset of just "wait for others to start jumping on board first"? As far as we know this is almost an "empty boat", if no ones on board yet then nobody would want to get on board. I mean that explains why some of us feel uncomfortable of being a pioneer, but the people who doesn't have the information and manipulated to adapt the lifestyle we have today (including us) have all the reasons to not go on board because they were not yet educated to know some consequences of our culture can lead us to. But we have been reading, learning and knowing a bunch of causes and solutions of the climate crisis, I'd say I feel obligated to be the "vanguard" to get on board myself. Because let's be honest, most of the solutions don't actually change our lives dramatically and are doable, maybe I will fail on convincing people to stay on board, but at least I could say I tried instead of feeling depressed about not able to do anything at all.
<br><hr>
The word "vanguard" itself is a neutral world. People used to use it to manipulate because it sounds good doesn't necessarily make it a politically biased, similar to how Nazi used a varied form of swastika as their symbol shouldn't make Buddhism related to Nazi. I personally believe using a single ideology to describe a class is limiting, and I don't see systemic radicalism and liberal individualism that contradicting since we have problems system-wise, at the same time we have individuals (most people) who doesn't take climate change so seriously. In fact one is closely related to each other: if we have enough individuals in our society who are environmentally friendly, then the system itself automatically changed; on the other hand if we obtain enough political power an start there, then we might be able to change peoples' lifestyles slowly. Thus they seem compatible for me enough, and Ken was just trying to tell us to try to do both? 

 <br><br>


Furthermore, I argue that people buy meats and take plane because it's easy AND they didn't know about the costs of environment behind it, if all people have accessed to those facts they might weight on if it's necessarily to buy meat and fly, then maybe they will decrease the amount of meat they eat or times they fly. (of course I am not denying meat is still an important source of nutrition and flying is an important way of transporting) Hell, at least people will be more likely to stop wasting food and fly 50 times a year, and I think that's a big difference we are making already. 
 <br><br>



We have to do it individually, and we have to do it together. One thing I strongly agree with you is that being a "vanguard" who do to feels good about himself is not enough, not saying it's not good to feel good about oneself, that's just basic needs for human, or maybe the first step of fighting the view of a depressing future. There are, indeed, way more of what we need to do, and I think Ken was a little scared or being too careful of words using because he didn't want to sound too influencing.

 <br><br>

Doing it doesn't seem enough is never the scariest thing, 
 <br><br>

the scariest thing is to not do anything because of it.
<br><hr>
I agree with many of the things you stated such as capitalism being detrimental and the necessity for large scale change, however I believe you CAN have it both ways. In fact the only way substantial change is going to happen is if we do have it both ways. I don't think Ken believes a major economic overhaul is going to happen through small individual changes, but rather that if individuals begin changing their consciousness about daily living, it will set into motion movements that give activists more power, wealthy people incentive, environmentalists a greater influence,  and politicians a change they must support. Yes, big things NEED to happen, but it's going to start with individual efforts because if everyone maintains the mentality that nothing will change until there are radical overhauls, then there will be no incentive to start now. It is imperative that we give power to the people and show that individual efforts do matter or else people will stay in their habits and the one's with real power in the world won't see a reactive need to support global change.

<br><hr>
 I believe that you have pointed out a lot of what we all are thinking. I like the baseline concept of the class, but at times I feel as though I am being indoctrinated rather than educated. I also do agree that to make change we need to attempt to find ways to make saving the world more realistic at a large scale like the article that we read this week. Coming together I believe is the most difficult part of this whole process because individually no matter how much we try to do whats best, if the law doesn't change, then the culture doesn't either.

<br><hr>
I really agree with your reply to this comment, and I am glad that you responded! I also found myself questioning what aspect was most important, individual change or system wide change. However, upon further reflection I don't think that either is more important that the other, but that they are equally important and even dependent on one another. How is a system wide change going to come about if there is no individual action taken? How is there supposed to be sweeping individual lifestyle changes if there is no system wide action taken? I think that Ken is, like you have said, combining these two ideas, which seem to be very conflicting, in order for us to realize that there should not be a time period where we wait for top-down change, and bottom-up change could not create the quick change we need. 

 <br><br>

There needs to be both, and I don't think that it is productive for us to sit back and wait (more like actively fight for, I know) for systemic change to take care of the climatic issues that our own, personal, individual actions are so drastically affecting. I think it is almost silly to debate what Ken is arguing in his lectures when the message is clear: we effect the environment; we should try to lessen our individual impacts, as well as fight for regulations/incentives/disincentives from the government in order to change the lifestyles of others.

<br><hr>
I get what you mean. Seeing his videos can feel like being in a relationship where your partner is constantly throwing mixed signals. Honestly, the main thing I'm getting from this class is that we need to do our own part as well as trying to elect officials that would help make change on a greater scale. As much as I try to avoid anything political, this is something political that would require certain actions from us. I really do believe, however, if we all come together (as you stated), we can end agricultural subsidies which would result in lower carbon emissions. I've been thinking about the idea for a while from watching Ken's videos and your comment made me realize more clearly the reasoning behind certain carbon emissions: it's due to availability/accessibility. If we make certain things harder to obtain, such as being able to purchase, this would change the behavior in many people across the country.
<br><hr>
This frustration has been with me throughout this class. It is truly impossible for citizens to end this crisis without a probably violent revolution. This is tragic, but it is also true that there are many people in this world who would rather see the world burn than take any chance of impacting their profits. Electing politicians to help is a wonderful idea, but corruption is real, and even if we have U.S. legislation, companies have no qualms going to other countries with less infrastructure to outsource labor. There is no winning. There is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Ken said, earlier in the course, that violence is not the answer. As much as I would love to agree, that just doesn't seem to be true. Every revolution in history has needed violence to take the corrupt out of power. Electing politicians and ~enacting change~ in vague, intangible ways will not work fast enough. We need to mobilize the public or accept the destruction of our planet.

<br><hr>
I agree with this comment in that a lot of solutions in this class are very conflicting and complicated, and honestly may not make a difference unless everyone stops living their lives completely. Yes, I feel as if it is important that we make our individual changes and make the most educated choices we can but it seems as if no matter what choice you are making, you are still hurting the climate in a different way. This ties in completely with the idea of real change only being viable if it is forced on us by law as Ken suggested in this video. If there is a plane with about 150 people on it as the general 737’s have, if 20 people don’t show up because they don’t want to mess with their climate footprint, the plane is still gonna take off and emit the carbon and pollution into the air. Sure, the individual person does not have the guilt being carried on their back, but it still happened. Until there is a huge, dramatic shift in the way we organize our society and what we value, our individual choices won’t really make the biggest difference. I’m glad this comment was made because I feel like it was worded perfectly, I totally get what Ken is trying to do but I feel as if the conflicting messages make it difficult for us to totally know what to do. It is really complicated for the average person to make sure that all of the products they are purchasing, foods they are eating etc are locally sourced and don’t emit such a climate footprint, and secondly, being environmentally friendly has a classist structure to it: the healthier, purest, and most eco-friendly things are generally more expensive or hard to find, and as long as there are food deserts where the only accessible foods are extremely processed and corporate, as long as people rely more on efficiency over sustainability because life is hard as it is, until we just start planting all our foods in local gardens and backyards, until we track the cycle of the seasons for vegetables and until we literally restructure our capitalist system and shift the entire mindset of a nation to prioritize life and health over wealth, I find it hard to see this vanguard thing actually happening.

<br><hr>
I totally agree that there seems to be such an odd intersection of the use of radical language along corporate-friendly and elite ideas that I constantly find myself facing the same question: What do you believe in Ken? Are you some Ellen Degeneress-esq libral elite that would betray ideology but not class, or are you a true radical: ready to fully reject and burn down the systems that prop-up both you (a white, rich, educated and influential thinker) and the climate crisis as we see it today. You want my opinion on whether or not we need a Vanguard? Well the obvious answer would be that you should be the vanguard we are all waiting for. As you stand up there in Campbell hall why are you not the one to organize and rally and lead us to a brighter future? Oh wait. I almost forgot. Your “job” ends with information just the same as my “job” ends with an A+ in this class. The whole reason we are learning all of this is not because we are about to embark on a journey to radically change the world, it's because we are already embarking on a journey of personal debt to a faceless legal entity known as the higher education system, and we all need GEs to graduate. 
 <br><br>
 At some point there needs to be a discussion in this class about the confluence between class-based revolution, liberal solutions just PC enough for you to keep your job, and the real reason why we ask if the climate revolution needs a leader to be effective: because without it we are all going to die.

<br><hr>


Indeed, this class could sometimes sound a bit aggressive and far-fetched. What Ken proposes is for the best for our planet, but it is hard to get everybody on board. We as humans are very bad at putting something not very tangible (our environment) in front of our own lives. Who would choose to not sit on a plane when it is cheap and safe and fast? Ken would be one, of course, maybe you and me and other guys in this class, but what about other fellow students in UCSB? Other people in Goleta? Other people in California?
 <br><br>

Ken’s initiatives, what I think, are simply the right things to do to let active environmentalists like you and me sleep better at night and forgive ourselves. The way of life of most people is destructive, yes, but it is impossible for the entire humankind to live in ways that are inconvenient or even suffering just for the sake of “our planet,” we are much more selfish than that.

<br><hr>
I think that when Ken mentions a Vanguard, he means that the people that are informed on this issue have to live out what we know will change the path to a more sustainable humanity. I feel like it means that we need to be a big group of people practicing actions that are good for the environment and not faltering at any point. It shouldn't be violent or like an uprising but if many people begin to practice this and form a 'vanguard', it would gain traction on the sole fact that so many people are doing it. It's good to do individual actions to help offset our own emissions but if only one person is doing it, there will be no effect. We need many people doing this and while doing this, informing others and encouraging them to join. There are a large number of people that see this as a problem and I think if a majority of those people put into practice sustainable ways of living, more people will follow suit and politics will change in order to reflect the majority opinion. It will be difficult to start but I think if everyone that's capable of taking action takes action, there will be change that follows.

As Ken emphasized in his lecture, the real change happens in our individual perspectives and habits. "if enough people take this seriously and work hard at it,... we can come up with good practices" is what he mentioned to point at the idea that we can collectively implement solutions that respect these conservation ideas, and establish them as necessary actions. From cutting down on automobile and air travel to switching to a plant-based diet, Ken asserts that these solutions would be effective ways to help reduce individual carbon footprint; in other words, these practices described in the video should be worked on and be considered as ways to mitigate the climate crisis by first cutting down individual carbon footprints, and then forging a path for similar practices and their relevance to the populations' lives. 
 <br><br>


"Are you an architect of the future?"
 <br><br>


This simple question posed by Ken at the beginning and end of the lecture video asks the each viewer whether they are able to make the change needed to rebuild and sustain the present, and create the future. I find Ken's attitude riveting because he's incredibly passionate about these changes which allows more information and perspective to be shared to younger generations, who may have not grown up with the same type of views in their close circles. Just something to chew on really...

For me, this lecture by Ken was my favorite so far. It called to attention something we all knew to be true. It is up to us, the western countries, to set cultural standards for how to live a life that minimizes the negative impact we have on the environment. I've always been interested in fitness and exercise, which for me also means nutrition, because you can't have one without the other. I've researched all the fad diets, from Keto to Paleo to Juice Cleanses, and one that is often overlooked is simply the plant-based diet. It is such a misconception that protein=meat, and when we get caught up thinking about how we're going to eat our next meal, we always plan around a protein. "Oh, we'll have steak with greens or potatoes on the side," "we'll have chicken with a side salad." Greens are not getting the respect they deserve. It made me mad that ad campaigns said "Beef is for dinner," and our American culture corrupted many ethnic foods by introducing the idea that beef is essential to every meal in America. If we really are to be the change that the world needs, we must advocate equally hard for plant based diets; we set the standards that the world will follow, regardless of Western countries wanting that responsibility or not.

I definitely believe that we must start acting now. We don’t have time to wait. We can all make a difference just by changing our diet and limiting food waste. For me, limiting food waste is a goal that has been instilled in me by my parents for as long as I can remember. As a child, my parents wouldn’t let me leave the dinner table until all of the food on my plate was gone. It was my responsibility to finish the amount of food that I grabbed. At the time, it seemed like punishment; however, looking back on it now, I’m very appreciative of this lesson that my parents taught me. Another thing that we pride in our house is our compost bin. My mom is extremely into gardening, which encouraged her to put a worm bin in our yard. In this bin are over 2,000 Red Wiggler Worms that create compost for our backyard garden. All of our fruit and vegetable scraps are fed to these worms, who in turn recycle this waste to be used to grow more food. For this reason, the amount of food that we waste is even less.

Based on my experiences at home, I’ve realized that it’s not always difficult to make changes in the ways we deal with food. But, as I’m taking my dishes over to the conveyor belt in DLG, I’m sad to see that the values instilled in me weren’t necessarily instilled in others. The amount of food that students waste in the dining commons is absolutely horrifying. People need to understand the profound impact that the food they waste can have on our environment. I believe that colleges need to better educate students on the impact of food in order for us to make a step in the right direction.

You took the words right off my mouth. I also grew up in a household where finishing all your food was a must. Overtime, I learned that having food in the first place was a blessing and not everyone has that privilege, thus leaving food behind was a waste of money, time, and resources. Like you, I also appreciate that my parents encouraged this behavior because by finishing what you eat goes a long way to reducing waste. This is definitely an action I will pass down to my future kids. Some people would disagree with the idea of pushing one’s child into eating something they don’t like or forcing them to finish their food even though they’re full, however letting this slide only builds a generation that thinks food comes and goes whenever they want. That after one or two bites you can push the plate away and move on to the next one. This brings me to my next point: the amount of food UCSB students waste is insane! Let me tell you something UCSB, stop getting food that you’re not going to finish! As someone who has worked at Portola, it is extremely disappointing to see full plates of food thrown away, it feels even worse to be the person who has to actually throw it away in the bin. The whole time I was just thinking how privileged some of you guys are. Yeah, some of you might think you’re not but then will put excuses such as: the food sucks, it was too cold, it didn’t taste like anything, it was too greasy, too this and that. You guys are college students that are supposed to be leading the way for a better future and throwing your food away doesn’t seem like it. It’s not just students at Portola but every single dining common here on campus. We need to act immediately and realize that we do have the power to modify our diet or just how much food we consume in order to care for our planet a little better. Are we really up to the challenge or would we be too lazy and hope others do it so we don’t have too?


<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you're saying. Growing up, even today, still, my parents have never presented it as an option to me to not finish all of the food on my plate. I agree that it seemed like a punishment at the time, especially as a kid with a plate full of vegetables. However I realize now how vital it is that we don’t waste food, so I’m also very grateful my parents instilled it on me at a young age to not waste any of the food on my plate.
 <br><br>

I do, however, feel the need to mention something I’m not so grateful for regarding how I eat with my family. Growing up in a Mexican household, many of the traditional dishes my family makes daily include meat. Given how Ken discussed how we should reduce our consumption of meat, it definitely makes me feel guilty to think of the amount of meat my family and I consume on a daily basis. As I’m living on campus and not at my family’s home at the moment, I don’t find it difficult to avoid eating meat. When I’m at home, it’s definitely a different situation, especially because my mom always has meals prepared and ready to eat, many of which contain meat.
 <br><br>

It’s vital that I do my part in communicating with them the importance of reducing our consumption of meat, but given that they are older and overall not so concerned with the issue of climate change, I will say I find it difficult to urge them to do so. For now, I can focus on watching the amount of meat I consume, along with sharing Kens videos with them to truly inform them on why climate change is such a pressing issue, and why we should be doing everything we can to stop it.
<br><hr>
I can totally relate with growing up in a household where food waste wasn't an option. Yes it was frustrating because when I was a kid I would sit hours at a time trying to finish a bowl of rice, but at the same time it did teach me a lot about the value and the hard work that goes into the production of food and and to be grateful for the things that are put on the table for you by your parents/family. However, for me, living away from home has in a way thrown things off a bit; I no longer live under the same schedule and the same habits. A Malcolm Gladwell book taught me that a lot of our behaviors actually heavily depend on context, or the environment. Therefore, now that I don't have anyone to nag me about wasting food anymore, and because I look around in the DC's and people do the same thing, I find that I often think to myself, "wasting just a bit won't hurt" and eventually it became a bad habit, as a result of not being mindful enough and not keeping myself accountable.
 <br><br>

I really like that you brought attention to how much food is being wasted across the dining commons in UCSB. However, I don't think it's completely the students' fault. When I came to UCSB, I was quite surprise that there are people on the other side of the counter serving the food onto your plate, because when I was in boarding school, the dinning common was similar to the one here except everything was self-served. I wonder why that is. I saw the servers plopped an entire mountain of scramble eggs onto this one person's plate before, and for me, is an unreasonable amount of eggs to eat in one sitting. So I feel like the problem with wasting food at UCSB is closely tied to the fact that the students can't always portion their own food. There should be a better system, like the employees should be trained to only give a certain amount, and then the student can ask for more, or come back for second if they want, or that the students get the food themselves. 
 <br><br>

I thought it was interesting that Ken mentioned in this video the fact that meat is tied to affluence and in a way, "success." Like you succeed in being able to put meat on the family dinner table, even though eating a plant based diet is so much healthier and can help a person avoid many health problems like cardiac diseases.
<br><hr>

I totally agree with what said in your common. I also think that we should definitely act immediately. In my mind, if I decide to do something I do not like wait but do it right now. I think sooner to act can always be better. For climate crisis, there’s no reason for us to wait to act until everyone everyone realize the necessity of acting. We should use our own behavior to teach others to act as what we do. Things like do not waste food are already general knowledge for everyone in the world, the problem is not there are someone do not know it but there are many who do not want to do it, although they know it is true. However, if many of the people around them do it as a social norm for him, it can be a better teacher for them than anything else. 
 <br><br>

 For myself, similar to what you said you do in your comment, I was also taught to finish everything in my plate when I was young by parents and teachers. As time goes on, it became a kind of habit for me to finish the food. Till now, I always finish all the things I take in the dining hall, and I prefer to go and take food more times after I finish all the things I take before. Although thee are still someone in the world who waste food. I decide to act first myself, because I think my personal action can also make tiny difference too. Although it is tiny, it must be better than nothing

<br><hr>
Do we need a climate vanguard? The answer to this question is yes, of course. Ken mentioned in the video that in America perhaps nobody will start to be the vanguard unless it is required to do so. I guess it is the same scenario in China as well. However, I believe that I can be the climate ‘vanguard’ in my family. I would love to live a life that is eco-friendly from now on, and suggest my family members to live a life that is eco-friendly from now on. I guess a lot of individual will agree with this idea, but I wonder, they, and I, how many of us, will really start the action, instead of just saying ‘I am glad to do so/I would love to do so.’

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that we definitely need to start acting now. It's great that you and your family have a compost bin! That's definitely a great way to ensure that no food goes to waste. I too have noticed all the food that goes to waste here on campus as well as other places such as grocery stores and restaurants. There's countless amounts of food that goes to waste and it's very unfortunate. Especially in developed countries, there's a large percentage of food that doesn't even reach these places because they don't "fit their standards" in regards to texture, color, and overall presentation when in reality there was nothing wrong with the product to begin with. I completely agree that we need to better educate individuals about the impact of food and food waste on our planet and what we can do about it.

<br><hr>
Yes, education is necessary for reducing food waste. Food waste is one of the major problems that leads to climate crisis. There are a lot of examples happening as well. People need more education about saving their food resources. They should have the consciousness of not wasting food. First of all, the producing of food is hard. It takes a lot of hard work of peasants. Secondly, there are many people out there cannot feed themselves well every day. Third, food waste decomposing is a problem for the Earth. This is a question that is as serious as the problem of eating less meat.

<br><hr>
I absolutely love that you have chosen to spin this issue that Ken is discussing and point it directly at us. People often watch videos like this and dismiss it as if they do everything correctly but food waste in the dining commons is nauseating to imagine. I have seen full plates of food completely untouched placed on those conveyor belts and this in itself if disgusting. And in the dining commons i believe something more can be done to promote sustainability and promote less food waste. Sometimes, people need to be reminded of the basics and if there is signage that makes them have a bit of a ‘reality check’ moment as they reevaluate how much food waste they are producing then a start has been made, 
 <br><br>

Another thing I found interesting about this video is that Ken mentioned that people may be afraid of switching to plant based diets based on their ‘cultural appropriations’ or their parents opinions. And the reason why I put ‘cultural appropriations’ in quotes is becuase I found it so interestig that Ken mentioned that we might actually be returning to our food roots by doing this, before our diets became corrupted by consumerism. This is something I had never thought about. While I think it might be scary for people to make the first step toward a plant based diet - even a diet where you are concious of the foods you are eating (choosing seasonal, local, organic foods and producing less waste), at this poing we really don’t have any other options.

<br><hr>
 I suggest people start to stop wasting food and start to accept plant-based diet, and don’t ‘point at’ people. Actually, plant-based diet contains countless nutrition. Vegetables with green leaves are really beneficial to our body. One thing that struggles me for nearly two year is UCSB Dinning Commons are lacking green vegetables. We only have spinach, etc, and that is far less than it should be. People should eat green vegetable at least every day, lunch and dinner. We shouldn’t eat too much meats.

<br><hr>
I am in complete agreement with you, we need to act now. We cannot wait for everyone to be on the same page before we act, we don’t have that kind of time. Waiting for everyone to be on the same page sounds foolish and outrageous to me. We are on a dangerous path why in any case would prolonging change make sense, what difference would it make from the prolonging that we have been doing for years. We as the world need wake up and realize that action is urgent.
 <br><br>
I was actually just at DLG today and thought exactly what you brought up, there is so much wasted food. It is actually a problem at all dining halls and very bad one at that because just think of all the students that eat there everyday, that is a lot of food wasted.
<br><hr>

You’re right. At this moment we need a vanguard to lead to stop wasting food, otherwise there would be only few people doing this. However, even if we can manage our food property, how do we make the restaurants, or even the dining common on campus to reduce waste? The food wasting in households dose not take a large portion of the amount of food wasting every year. According to recent statistics, more than 80% of unused food in American restaurant are being disposed of. This huge amount are way larger than what we can save in household dining. Thus, Even if we change our diet and limit food waste, there are some a large amount of food waste that cannot be alleviated.

<br><hr>
I agree that we should start action before other people start. Also, I believe UCSB Dining Common and even everywhere in the world should set some rules to decrease and avoid wasting food. Wasting food is wasting resources on the Earth. Wasting resources will lead to lack of resources. Lacking resources will lead to huge issues when hunger strikes. ‘Globalization’ says people shouldn’t be divided. Instead, people should know to take care of each other, so that peace can restored.
<br><hr>
Probably Ken and our other classmates are right. Maybe people really should have the power and right to vote, so that new legislations can be push forward. For example, vote for regulations of reducing food wastes. Set punishment for firms and people who waste food. Give more education to students at school about saving food, etc. If it has to take what it has to take, then do it. There is no better ways to push forward good things.
<br><hr>

I think that what you said is great because it can the bring back up the point of how important legislation is. If most food is wasted at grocery stores and restaurants the I think legislation that forces regulations on these businesses to stop wasting food can be very beneficial.
<br><hr>
Besides legislations, personal actions are important as well. Buy less food if won’t eat too much. Don’t throw away too much food. Have a good eating habit. Schools should educate students to save food from a young age. Also, growing food is not an easy job, which is why people should respect others’ hard work. Saving food can make the lives of peasants easier. If more people are conscious of this, the food waste problem will be solved.

I am astounded everytime I watch one of your Ken’s videos by how little I was informed. Never did it occur to me that eating asparagus in winter in the US was just as bad as eating beef because of the air travel that takes such a toll on the environment. There are all these human-made things we have taken on as a society that are so a part of our everyday life that it really makes me ponder an answer to Ken’s question: should we take individual action or wait until everyone is on board? I think there has already been quite a lot of individual action being taken. I also think a large part of this issue is these huge companies and industries that make profit off of these fossil fuels and don’t want to give that up. It is interesting that the meat industry signifies wealth, but I think already increasingly more people have been eating less and less beef even when they are the most wealthy, and switching more to lean meats like chicken and fish. I have noticed this because I work at a relatively nice restaurant where people often prefer fish to stay “lean”. I think more and more these days, especially in California, vegan food has become trendy and more expensive. I have started to see more and more trendy food places in LA that will charge huge amounts of money for a plate of specially prepared vegetables. This is only in certain cities in the world though. Elsewhere, this isn’t really a thing. I think if we can start getting this more popular around the world, more money will go into these plant based foods and slowly farming will gradually change.

This week’s lecture was particularly interesting for a number of reasons. I like that Ken ties in a call to action in all his videos. He asks us if we should start taking action now (the right answer) or if we should wait for everyone to be on board. Like any other large-scale movement, things don’t happen overnight. It will require the people who choose to start now rather than wait until it is a law. So far, regarding diet all I have understood from this class is that we need to go plant-based. This video was helpful because it explained how it matters more about the types of foods and how far they needed to travel. For example, it would be better to eat chicken once a day as a meat-eater rather than be vegetarian but consume lots of dairy. I also agreed with the need to find better uses for food to reduce waste such as beet leaves and watermelon rinds. I’m sure there are plenty of ways to use lots of the parts of food that we normally toss. Finally, I really support the idea of a climate label in addition to a nutrition label on all food products. I would definitely take the time to see the climate impact I am making when I choose my food at the store. For example, I had no idea that it was horrible for the climate to be eating asparagus in the winter because it has to travel so far (flying being terrible for our carbon footprint). Overall I really liked this week’s lecture because it expanded upon previously mentioned topics that I still had questions about.

<p>

After watching the lecture video this week, I loved the idea of switching from a beef diet to plant-rich diet. Plant-rich diet is definitely more beneficial to the environment and a lot healthier than the beef diet. However, like Hiltner said, it would be difficult for us to adapt due to our cultural preferences and how society made us accustomed to certain dishes like meatballs, pasta sauce, pizza and etc. To exemplify, the concept of slowly transitioning and introducing ‘vegetable protein’ to our meals seems to be an ideal move. Personally, when I first got to eat a vegetable protein patty, It tasted weird and sketchy. I felt like a goat eating grass. However, I also noticed that after consuming that vegetable protein patty, my energy span for the day was extended compared to when I eat a regular beef patty. Furthermore, Hiltner mentioned the idea of adding ‘environmental labels’ to our food nutritional labels. Personally, as someone who is a body builder, whenever I go grocery-shopping, I always look at the back of the food I am buying and value each number from the nutrition label religiously. I believe it would be a good add-on to the nutrition label and at the same, could act as an eye-opener to some people if we put something like ‘Food accounts for 10-30% of household carbon footprint’. Unfortunately, this will only be possible if we elect the right leaders that aren’t only looking to fulfill their capitalistic view but rather, would also be wholeheartedly committed to save the planet.

As I learning through this climate crisis course, I realized every perspectives of our life will pose different extent of effects to the climate. And the climate change has become more and more serious at this moment. It has already been six weeks from beginning of this class, and I learn how worse our environment is without too much solutions. This is obvious that negative sides of climate crisis exceeds the positive one. 
<br><br>
Actually, I think I cannot be called as vanguard, but I always do better than others. I pay attention to use public transportation as more as possible both in China and America, for example, I always prefer to take bus to schools instead of driving my private car; I pay attention to influence people around me to change their thoughts of environment and join me to protect it, for example, I always tell my parents to drive cars or take flights less frequently; I always pay attention to produce less food waste, for example, I always buy less things when I go to supermarket in order to make sure that I could consume all of them during certain time period. However, there are still some inevitable things that will increase my “ donation” to carbon dioxide emission, including: taking long- distance flights between America and China, live in a big apartment.
<br><br>

To be honest, no one in this earth could be called as vanguard. The reason behind it is that everyone in this world will lead to production of carbon dioxide, nobody could say that she or he dose not affect climate at all. This is totally impossible. However, as all people work together to solve this problem. It could be regard as a large group of vanguard. In conclusion, what we should do now is realize the origin of climate crisis clearly and take care of every aspects of everyone’s life. I believe that although the carbon dioxide level will not drop dramatically, it will definitely keep at the constant level without further effects.

This video made me feel really really torn. I want to be an activist for the planet so badly and help be part of the "Vanguard" but it is so damn hard. There are so many things that can be done, and some are easier than others. Recycling and taking my bike to class are simple things, and I already vote Democratic so I feel like I'm concurrently supporting the climate in that way, but when you look at big picture things I feel like I am not doing enough. I want to eat a fully sustainable diet but I think for me there are two main struggles that arise. One, I really do like a lot of the foods that I eat like meat and dairy that are not sustainable and it is just hard to exercise prolonged self control and stop myself from indulging. Secondly, I feel like it make it so much harder for me when I see other people eating whatever they want and I think to myself "If we are all going to be affected by climate change, why am I the only one who has to suffer because of it?" I know that this is not a good frame of thinking, and I feel selfish for vocalizing it, but I really do think that it would be so much easier if I felt a sense of "we're all doing this for the greater good" in American society. Instead a lot of my family and relatives just think that it's silly that I do what I can (which isn't very much). Regardless, I do still feel this call to be a frontrunner and do what I can.

I totally get you with wanting to do more and really get out there, but I will tell you this not all Democrats are good Democrats, you have to look into who's providing them with funds as some receive money from big oil or they don't really fight for regulation that would better the environment. I also feel like there are many people in food deserts who face your same crisis of wanting to diet better for the environment or even people who aren't in food deserts who don't know where to begin. Like for some going towards a vegan or vegetarian diet is unfamiliar and seems like a path of just eating salad and fruits, but there are lots of options just people need the knowledge on how to do so. But another issue is for those who live lives where it isn't as easy to be able to cook for themselves all the time and must resort to fast food which isn't eco-friendly, so I feel like developing more eateries where more options are provided would be nice or at least restaurants could have more options in their menus. I'm still consuming meat and dairy, but something I try to do is eat less red meat as somewhat a step in the right direction.

Growing up with a very Italian father, I was always taught that food and drinks are a large aspect in socializing and special occasions. You chat and socialize while eating whether it be small appetizers or a whole meal, I was always taught that this is how you entertain people in your home, you feed them! In high school, I had proposed possibly becoming pescatarian and my father told me, "I will not cook for you if you choose to do this." Understandable, he didn't want to cook something separate for me because of a diet I wanted to try out but this totally makes me think of Ken's point how food is largely impacted by your culture and upbringings. As my fathers diet is not a "traditional" Italian diet, it is definitely largely meat based and I would say he would cook some sort of beef or chicken with every dinner, and it totally affected by the American diet. With all the new vegetarian meat options like the "beyond burger" and the talk of making lab meat, maybe one day I can convince my father to eat a more plant based diet, even though he's always been against it.




</p><hr>



<p>

After watching Ken’s video about food, I think I have some experience of shifting the diet. There are so many reasons for people not wanting to give up on the meat, or even just eat less meat then they usually do. I went to a boarding school where the cafeteria does not serve meat due to religious reasons. And during that time, I could only eat meat when I went out, where I can buy my own food. With that being said, I feel like I became not so in need of eating meat. To be honest, I feel like I have never felt healthier than that. So not only there is the fact that eating less meat could save the planet, but people should also be considering the benefit they can get for their health from consuming less meat. And there are more and more people who started or have already shifted their diet to a plant-based diet due to multiple reasons. At the end of the day, whatever the reason could be for a person to shift their diet, the climate could be benefited from that.

When I was a kid, me and my family liked to do self-drive travel a lot. I really enjoyed it because I was able to see a lot of things, and spend more time with my family, which I can never experience in a flying travel, where the only thing I can see out of the window is the clouds and the only way I can spare time is either to sleep or watch TV. Considering how much emission a flying travel contributes to, I really suggest to travel with an alternative, such as public buses and trains, which emit much less compared to cars and airplanes.
<br><br>
In our combat against climate crisis, I think it’s really important for us to think how an alternative can help us in improving our life quality in the first place, and only when we see the benefits of doing it, we can introduce the lifestyle to other people, and let more people practice it, which together helps exponentially reduce emission collectively.

For most of my life, I tended to fly to whatever destination I was trying to reach. I did pay attention to the beauty of the clouds, or the aesthetic of the sunsets; I only focused on the relative quickness and convenience of air-based travel. But after this summer, that mentality changed. After taking a ten-hour bus ride from Santa Barbara to Berkeley, I realized that using public modes of transportation are not only more environmentally friendly (per capita), but also much more beautiful in the experience. I got to see the many different communities of the California coastline, and amazing landscapes that could only be recreated in movies. Since then, I have taken a bus to anywhere I'm trying to go, and it prompted the realization that the journey is, in fact, more important than the destination. 
<br><br>


Unfortunately, however this mentality is only held by a slim minority of the American population. If activists could try to portray this message to deniers, then maybe they'd not only help the planet, but be a little happier in the process. I find it ironic that although deniers' lives are as convenient as can be, they still struggle to find genuine happiness. But if they managed to see past this convenient lifestyle and witness the reality of the situation, then maybe they could begin to make up for their mistakes that they have made in the past.

<br><br>

I firmly believe that this is what a climate vanguard can do effectively. They could try to level with deniers and put the issue into perspective for them (almost like speaking a different language that they could understand). Even though this could be potentially difficult to organize, it is worth the risks so that we could help protect our planet.

Yes, from my perspective, I do find us needing a vanguard, which minimalists can be an excellent example of it, I remember in the movies Minimalists: I like the way how the director tries to explain how minimalists live- from day to day life and common family situations. Every benefit of being minimalists begins with a personal story,which wakes people’s sympathy,and then describes the changes by interviewing and videos in details to make sure people can visualize whether a minimalist life is what they want. And I feel so optimistic about it, since it really considers about the environment and reflects whether the daily actions of humans are right. This kind of video just like exactly what the lecture is talking about, is something that inspires people to protect the environment. We need to change the way we are treating the environment and accept the truth that it is getting worse indeed. We cannot convert it but however we can change the situation in time probably by new technologies. Meanwhile the nature has its own power to recover, so there is no need to act panic or rush.  We should intellectually stay optimistic.

Ken poses the question "Do you want to be part of the group rushing out ahead of everybody else and boldly forging a new future" and I believe this is what will separate what the rest of our future and our children futures lives will revolve around. The things that we can do about this are not easy but the steps need to start being made so that we can ensure that ourselves and future peoples will have a planet to live in. I think that electing politicians, as Kens states, is the largest and most effective thing that we could currently do to start furthering out situation instantly. The politicians currently in office largely ignore the consequences of the climate crisis and this is evident. A carbon takes seems like a great idea but people need to stop flying and contributing to main pollution causes as soon as they can. This would drastically reduce the emissions that people on average have been forcing onto their planets throughout their life times. I find the things that Ken has done throughout his life to be extremely encouraging. He not only teaches about the ways in which we can reduce emissions and create a better future for our planet, but he himself has already taken action. I would have never thought a G.E. class would have been so relevant to the world in which I live in today. I think that if people are going to have to take so many silly prerequisites when entering college, a course on the climate should be mandatory. People across the U.S. need to learn the consequence of their actions and need to learn how we can step up and create a better future for this planet. I am encouraged by the amount of things we can do to cut down emissions, but also discouraged with the deep rooted complacency that surrounds the American citizens. We need to do better as a whole country and as individuals.

I was surprised by this vedio. it make me think about things that i never ever thought of. i never know it cost hundreds of
<br><br>
million dollars to treat a fire. in the past, i only knew that climate change was just simply due to greenhouse gas emission. i also thought we only need to worry about damage made by fires. I am really sad that bangladesh could not afford to fix flood damage. again, I appreciate that ken expained these ways to solve the problem. i believe that the green new deal is going on a right direction, but it is not possible for some pepople to give up increasing growth of incomes. the only way to achieve this goal is that people in power have pure intention to help inneed countries, which is, however, regarding to previous case of US involvement, merely get a chance to succeed.

This video made me think of a song lyric I heard recently that goes, “If I speed it up. Is it fast enough?” It really makes me question if we are making our environmentalist changes quickly enough to actually make a difference in the climate crisis. I agree with Ken that we should try to speed up the movement and not wait around for the rest of the world to form a plan. The time to take action is now, we have no time to waste.

<br><br>

 I personally am planning on voting for Bernie in the 2020 California primaries, and hopefully the presidential elections, because he has a lot of policies that are pushing towards a greener and more sustainable way of living, and I hope that a lot of other people consider him as a candidate and vote because I know he will make the changes necessary to save our planet. However although I am all for policies like a carbon tax, I think it's important to note that it is the poorer people in the world who will be hurt the most by its changes, because they don’t have the money required to make the accommodations necessary.

I definitely agree with your comment. It can feel, at times, like this is completely hopeless, at that taking action to fix it is futile. However, we still can change this, if we act now. A vote for Bernie, I believe, is the right action. Not only because he has so many great ideas about how to address the climate crisis, but because he has created such a strong youth movement. As Ken pointed out in one of his earlier videos, this crucial to solving the climate crisis. I believe that Bernie Sanders winning the nomination would encourage young voters and make them more likely to vote in the next election because they feel they have a say.  The baby boomers, and even the gen Xers at this point, have had plenty of time to mitigate climate change and made insufficient progress. It's our turn.

<br><br>
I have one question, however: if Bernie doesn't win, will you still vote? Because, and I cannot stress this enough, a Trump victory will doom the planet. This next decade is probably the most important one, environmentally, in the next 100 years, and we cannot afford to leave almost half of it to someone who denies climate change's existence.

I feel like most of the information from the lecture today was information that I had already heard before. The importance of a plant based diet and the harms of air travel. But, one thing that stood out to me was the climate labels. I think this would benefit so many people who want to make a difference but don’t know how. Now, instead of making decisions based on price, it could be based on the harm to the environment. When looking at two of the same product, I wouldn’t know which one was more harmful to the environment, so these labels would really help me make an informed decision. I don’t even know when certain foods are in season and when they were probably imported. I don’t see why you wouldn’t want to be a climate vanguard. I personally don’t know if i’ve done enough to call myself a climate vanguard, but it’s important that we at least try to start on an individual level in making differences, instead of waiting for the masses. The way I view it, mainstream practices had to start off with only a few individuals, so I think this could apply to the climate crisis. However, this is more of an urgent situation, and we can’t hope that all these practices become mainstream and that changes are being made on an institutional level, we need it to become a reality. Another important thing mentioned was the amount of food being wasted. I was brought up to always finish the food I put on my plate, and to save leftovers. Even when going to restaurants back home, I try my best to finish my meal, and if I don’t think I can I will split a meal with my brothers. But, man are the portions in the States huge! I can never finish my meals, and it worries me to think how much waste they’re producing trying to provide such big portions (that are unnecessarily large).

I personally think there is an important value in having a vanguard for the climate; just think about the old adage, "be the change you wish to see in the world." A lot of change will mostly be brought by environmentalist politicians, yes,  but we simply do not have enough time to wait for the rest of the country to catch up with the environmentalist movement. Even in 2020, Bernie Sanders, who has been an activist for the environment for the majority of his career, is likely to lose the democratic primaries to Joe Biden, whose opinions on the environment have only changed lately to reflect the wishes of the democratic party. This is only in the Democratic Party, too--just think about the Republican Party who favors economic progress and stability more than environmental issues.

One of the more interesting things I learned in this video is the prospect of changing your diet in accordance to the environment in a way that doesn't include just going vegetarian or vegan. It was interesting to learn about asparagus, and how eating it during a certain time of the year is environmentally worse than being vegetarian, due to its transportation via airplane.  Changing your diet is probably one of the harder parts of being more environmentally conscious, but I think with careful thinking, and maybe some law-implementation by politicians, it can be done in America.

In my household I grew up always having meat as a part of my meals, whether that be chicken, beef, or turkey. My family immigrated here from a country where those who consumed meat on a regular basis were considered wealthy. From time to time my mom would cook meals that contained no meat and my father would always say something along the lines of “a meal without meat is not a meal.” Looking back I understand how their culture influenced them to consume and believe such things but I now see how bad it is for the environment. Although my family and I would consume meat more than the average family my mom would always have us eat everything on our plate and save any leftovers. Growing up I never thought much about how bad consuming meat everyday was to my carbon footprint. It wasn’t until my junior year in AP Environmental Science that I actually started to learn about things like this since my previous science teachers were anthropogenic climate change deniers and didn’t teach us about how our actions affected the environment. Since then I have cut back on my meat intake.  Ken mentioned a carbon tax being implemented on everything that emitted carbon into our environment such as planes and cars. If this tax were to be expanded to other greenhouse emitting gases such as methane then the  meat industry would be affected as well. This would lead to people being healthier and our carbon footprints would be lower too. If that were to happen one day then most likely the meat industry would have to cut back on their production.

After watching Ken's collection video, I really had a lot of ideas and some confusion at the same time. I very much agree that taking a plane will produce a lot of carbon emissions, so we should try to reduce this behavior. However, there are some long-distance and time-consuming trips that I have to take by air, such as going to school or work in different countries. I would prefer to take other means of transportation to get rid of these. Although it may take more time, I think I have made at least my own contribution to environmental protection. On the issue of diet, I agree that it is important to reduce food waste, and that the production and consumption of meat will indeed cause more carbon emissions, but I am a bit confused about advocating vegetarianism. I think the focus should be on promoting the reduction of food waste. As Ken said, reducing driving and traveling, and choosing more buses. It is very difficult for a person to play a role, and it must be a collective one In order to change the status quo. I think the same is true of reducing food waste. Only when we call for boycott collectively, can we eradicate the problem, not boycott the meat diet.

Something that really appealed to me from this lecture is when Ken mentioned that there should be climate labels on the food we eat. I feel like this idea is something that would be extremely positive for our environment. I personally do not really know what food is in season or not when I eat it and I believe that most people do not know either. Therefore I truly believe that having these types of labels on our products would influence people on whether to consume them or not. This would really help our planet and the emissions that we produce.
<br><br>
To answer Ken's question I do think that a climate vanguard is necessary. I think that it is very important to bring awareness to people about the environmental issues that our planet is currently facing. I also believe that it is extremely important to make sure that people now how easily and accessible it is to help the planet. I feel like most people think that they need to make a drastic change to help our planet and they think that it would require too much effort from their part and is why they don't really do anything. I think that if people knew how easy it was they would really make a change.

I believe that one of the biggest things that the government can do is put climate labels on foods. This way, the public can be educated and we can all make healthier decisions for our planet. This would also raise massive awareness on the issue, and would help Americans to think about their decisions before buying food. Similarly, I also think a good solution for the fast fashion industry is if they put the price that people making that piece of clothing are getting paid per hour on the tag. I think that one of the main issues regarding the climate crisis is that people are simply not educated enough about it or don’t think that they can actually make an impact. However, that could change with climate labels. Not only do I think it would help the consumer change their ways of eating, but possibly the producer would want to find a more climate-friendly way to produce their products once sales begin to go down.
<br><br>
It gives me hope knowing that at least some countries, such as Denmark, are doing something to find a solution to the climate crisis. However, America, as a “leading nation” needs to lead the world in this fight to combat climate change. It makes me concerned how many people believe that it would take too much work to help change the planet. Like you said, I agree with the fact that  it is extremely important to make sure that people know how easily and accessible it is to help the planet. I do believe people can make the change.

When I took psych, I learned about a concept called social loafing, which is the tendency for people to exert little to no effort when in a group setting as opposed to when they work alone. I think that this applies to the climate crisis and it explains why so many people won't make the changes they need to in order to prevent the issue from getting worse. We all just assume that our efforts won't change anything because we're only one person. I think that if some people really just take time to fully understand the problem of climate change and actively make changes in their lifestyles to combat it, then they can influence others and the chain can go on like that. When the situation gets extremely bad and we have no other choice BUT to change our lifestyle, people will start to regret not making changes earlier. This isn't just an individual thing, as climate change affects everyone. If you are making changes to your own lifestyle but won't even try to push others in the same direction, your efforts might be futile because, once again, this isn't an individual issue but one that affects all of us. It is necessary that those of us who know about the consequences of climate change and are aware of ways to prevent it try our best to influence others as well. In the end, if we don't all work together nothing will be solved.

Agreed. Much of the success of reverting climate change inherently relies on individuals making lifestyle choices for no perceptible direct gain. These lifestyle choices range from simple ones such as shopping less to ones that may be nearly impossible, such as avoiding air travel. As you highlighted, psychological studies have shown time and time again that individuals will exert no effort to change their habits as they expect the group to do it for them. 

<br><br>

To add to what you're saying: they is a famous thought experiment that arose from political science called the prisoner dilemma that essentially states that two individuals will, in a case of uncertainty as what the other individuals decision will be, end up doing what is ultimately most beneficial to them individually. I think that this effect will take hold in people's view of the climate crisis and that the lack of transparency in people's habits will encourage people to not make lifestyle changes. The only way to combat this is through more media highlighting the benefits of being environmentally conscious and turning this lifestyle into a desirable status symbol.

I think regarding the posted lecture, we do need a sort of “climate vanguard” to help inspire change within people. As seen from Cowspiracy and Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming, it will not be the corporations that encourage us to change our ways of life because they profit from us overindulging ourselves on the planet’s resources. If we continue as we do now, it is quite likely that it will be too late by the time we decide to collectively change as a species. However, if a “climate vanguard” were to start spreading the word around, it would increase our chances. 
<br><br>

Unfortunately, this is only a very small solution to a much larger problem. I do not see this measure being very effective because of how adamant people are against making sacrifices. It is safe to assume that people are amenable to making generally beneficial changes, whether for themselves or the environment in regards to this course, with little to no sacrifices on their part, yet they can become much more hesitant when it makes their lifestyle overall less convenient to live for a cause that would not seemingly affect their day-to-day lives very much. The only way many people will be willing to change is through many reforms and changes to the structure of our society that would make this transition easier, which is a very complex problem in and of itself. Even then, I wonder how effective it could be when people are so used to their comfortable lifestyles.

I think that the concept of a new, sustainable conference model in theory sounds very enticing and perfect, yet is probably not something that most people would think is doable or as effective as the conference models that are already in place. From what I know about conferences there is a reason why everyone meets in person, no matter how far the distance. The importance of face to face contact truly influences interactions and therefore I do not believe that this solution to air travel (in terms of traveling for conferences at least) can be completely solved with this solution. 

<br><br>

In terms of the food production issue, I believe that the waste that people generate with food is unbelievably unacceptable. Besides waste, I think if it was easy for people to change their diet to a plant based diet they probably would however as mentioned in this video it is not a viable option for many. For example, I remember in high school I tried to eat a vegetarian diet for a month as an experiment for one of my classes at school. My parents did not support this choice as they had to buy me different food and meals then the rest of our family, and because of this strain on my parents, I ended up having to quit. Although I myself would absolutely have been ok with the diet, it was just not doable because of the lifestyle my parents have taught and led our family with.

After watching this video it really made me think about everything that I have learned so far in this course and about my daily life alongside thinking about the lifestyle of those close to me. There are definitely things that can be done in order to help the climate change and stop the earth from warming as fast as it is, however, there are still many people in denial or disagreeing with the fact that there is currently a climate crisis. That is something major as it is impossible to convince a lot of people who are already stuck on the idea that this is a hoax to change their minds. Especially if they are of the older generation and a lot of the people advocating for change are the newer and younger generation. The issue about electing politicians is something major, as they are what decides how the politics and what changes are going to be established throughout the state or nation in order to help with the climate crisis. One of the most major issues is the companies and industries that refuse to leave fossil fuels in order to make money and profit. I believe that even though there are still people that disagree, there is no way that you will be unable to get everyone on board and their disagreement will ensue, so the best thing is to act now and secure the future for the future generations, a good one instead of having it be full of misery.

I really agree with you. There are always going to be some groups who deny the climate crisis. As a result, just act and starting to make changes. As you said, one of the most important steps is to elect someone to support the climate crisis. Change needs to be done from the top. As the nation set the goal and start the set the example, people will imitate and help with the climate crisis.

After watching this lecture video, I’ve realized the amount of food that I’m wasting as I eat at the dining commons at least once a day. Most of the time I grab a plate just to try it, but not end up liking it and leaving most of it. That food cannot be saved for later and adds to the food wasted by college campuses everyday. Realizing this has made me rethink how I eat at the dining commons. I should only get the amount of food I think I will eat, not just anything that sounds good or I want to try. 
 <br><br>
Ken does a good job of explaining how people will only take action once they see others do the same. It is crazy to think that people will only do something that will make a change for our planet if others are doing it too. 
<br><br>
 I found it interesting that the US is the country that most includes meat consumption in its diet. The American diet full of animal products is harming our planet and we continue to do it.
<br><br>
 Reducing food waste and thinking about what we eat is vital to our planet’s health. I hope that we are able to encourage each other to do better for the sake of our planet and constantly keep in mind that what we eat, will either be good or bad for the future of earth.

I agree that I became painfully aware of how much food I was wasting when I cooked as I would cook to much and become lazy to packing it away and would throw the left overs away. It was never a lot of food thrown away but it definitely adds up. I realize that a lot  of what I throw away is animal based products which are incredibly water intensive and I realized that I am wasting huge amounts of nutrition. I also learned that our high beef consumption is american culture and that it isn't prevalent in other places of the world. The beef campaign in the 1900s really drove the market and put the idea into american thought that a meal isn't a meal without beef.

I would love to see aggressive taxation on things like carbon emissions and meat production and sale. I think taxation and government regulation are key and essential to tackling this issue. However, I don’t think Americans will ever want to implement these sort of controls for a variety of reasons – whether they see them contrary to the American dream, socialist, communist, or they just don’t want to have to pay more. My home state, Washington, which I would argue in some ways is more left leaning than California, almost became the first state with a price on carbon. The initiative, however, failed a statewide vote, after it was modeled after what was considered to be a well-liked implementation in British Columbia. I do not think that Kens assessment of the carbon impact of flying is that relevant to this discussion, as it does not have a very significant overall impact on the crisis, however it does illustrate a good picture of how a carbon tax should work to wean us off fossil fuels. On the topic of food, however, I see the same parallel can be drawn. We should be taxing meat and animal products at high rates – as the luxury items they are – because we want them to be decreased/eliminated from the American diet. Again there are tons of reasons why this is very difficult, especially for Americans, however I am a strong believer that people will not make a change unless they are forced to – that behavioral changes, on any relevant scale, rarely come from people wanting to do it, especially if it means them taking a loss. I don’t think we can wait for cultural changes to occur, or even make the changes ourselves, but rather we have to force them upon society through means like taxation, and use tax revenues to invest in more sustainable practices, whatever they may be (renewables, education, women’s empowerment, etc.).

I think the idea of having conferences online would be extremely beneficial. I, however, know that in-person conferences inspire connections and create networking within and between businesses. I think that, rather than cease in-person conferences, there should be annual get togethers, where environmentally-friendly means of transportation can be planned and arranged in advance. I don't think people should stop flying completely. Traveling is one of my favorite things to do. If we worked on ways to improve air travel rather than just expect people to stop flying, then we can make improvements! People can inspire others, but if people berate, lecture, or confine others, no one is going feel inspired or ready to change their habits. If the approach is carefully tactful, then people will be ready.

Going through college I’ve had a primarily meat based diet (well really just ground beef & eggs). This lecture again made me think about how I should start moving away from that. 
<br><br>

On the other hand, if we collectively more towards a specific diet, I feel like corporations would cash in on the opportunity and systemize the process for the best cash flow. Cultural shifts will eventually lead to corporate shifts in the way they are run, and I know positive cash flow is the end goal. This poses the question, just how much can we change without it ending up as an issue towards our climate again? Can these cultural shifts end up in factories which still emit dangerous levels of CO2?

This video mainly talks about trying to control our diet to vegetables only which could also offer enough protein and other nutrients that we daily need in order to reduce our carbon emissions and limit our carbon footprint. Thinking about myself, I think it is hard for me to totally abandon present diet patterns and become a vegetarian, however under the pressure of global warming and large amounts of CO2 emissions, I should consider it seriously and make an effort to be a part of change. In this case, we do need a "vanguard" to instruct us and be the first one to set a good example for public. Additionally, as Ken mentioned in the beginning, another way to control our carbon footprint is to vote for carbon tax and begin to accept price tax. Individually, we are supposed to take less flights or even stop taking planes. This will do bring some trouble into our daily life like Ken cannot go to many international academic conferences without taking airplanes but he is in fact being a "vanguard" of saving our world from higher temperature and worse situation so we should learn something from him.

After watching the video this week, I was thinking of changing from a meat diet to plant-rich eating regimen. Plant-rich eating routine is unquestionably increasingly useful to nature and significantly more beneficial than the meat-filled diet.
<br><br>

I think we time and again neglect the different possibilites that are open to us. Keeping up a neighborhood diet, which is given by ranchers markets or nearby cultivators, is a technique that I accept ought to be progressively advanced. Items consistently originate from some place and things don't simply mysteriously show up at the stores, which I accept is very neglected. By buying items that are from closer areas and that help those business sectors, it makes a chain response where the neighborhood economy is filled, expanding request and supply. Purchasing the less expensive option could be from over the world, contributing enormously to a people carbon impression. I trust Ken examines this more in address! 
<br><br>

A ton of the things like dietary patterns and utilization designs are close to home and every one of us reserve the privilege to pick what we need to do.e.g to eat. To buy,etc. The significant motivation behind why individuals won't make a move and decline to concede the issues or are not taking enough activities to address the issue are on the grounds that it is possible that it will hurt their monetary advantages or essentially brings them burden. Be that as it may, in the event that we don;t care about what we do to our earth and depend on others for transforms, we are not pushing ahead toward our objectives and the issue can never be unraveled. In this way, I consider everybody us have to think ourselves as somebody who can make changes and spread the information and data we know to others so everybody will transform their insight into capacity to spare the planet we are living.

I also reevaluated my diet after this week’s lectures, readings and film. A switch to a largely plant-based diet is greatly better for the planet. 
<br><br>
I initially thought that mostly every person on earth ate a largely meat-based diet. Therefore, I was very surprised when Ken mentioned that many ethnic meals have been “Americanized,” by adding a large amount of meat to such foods. This really stuck to me and made me think. It seems as though industries have largely ingrained themselves in every aspect of the public lifestyle and consciousness, from the normalization of driving cars to eating large amounts of meat in our diet. I think that a lot of “American” culture is the normalization of practices enabled from corporations and wealthy interest groups. Again, we see driving cars as normal because of the amount of investment in public roads and see eating large amounts of meat due to a cultural indication of “wealth” as normal. We have to reevaluate what we see as normal.
<br><br>
Therefore, I agree with you that we neglect the different possibilities that are open to us because we have normalized environmentally unsustainable lifestyles; we can’t see it any other way. An example is seen in a point that Ken made in the lecture; we can waste less food, not just by seeing what and how much we throw away, but also how we look at food. When we think of beets, we think of just eating the root and not the greens, but the greens are edible and nutritious. Furthermore, watermelon rinds are edible. What we think can’t be eaten, could possibly be, or even made into something useful. Indeed, the climate crisis requires a lifestyle change and that means we rethink everything that we have normalized. Ken emphasizes this point by giving us a personal example. He has reduced how much he flies even though to many, it seems there is no other alternative. Though this is a difficult action, he nonetheless shows us that there are alternatives to things we think there aren’t alternatives to. Therefore, I think that many people, especially in first world countries are able to engage in finding environmental alternatives to wasteful practices. This can be encouraged by policies that support environmental alternatives and such alternatives would encourage a cultural change. This cultural change therefore would need to be a collective change, as it would be more impactful.

I feel like Hiltner brings up a very interesting question in this video that I could definitely see both sides to. I personally agree with Ken and believe that we cannot simply wait around until the rest of the world decides that they are ready. I feel like we all need to start with ourselves and do what we can to help because who knows how long the entire world will catch up? However, I also believe that we will not be able to make any significant difference in the climate crisis without a worldwide agreement and regulations being put in place specifically for this issue. Something brought up in this video that I found particularly interesting was that Denmark is starting a process where food will be labeled with how environmentally friendly it is, just like with nutrition labels. I feel like this is a very minor change that is being made but it is at least a start. I feel like we definitely need a lot more changes similar to this one that changes something systematically rather than just individually.

Just like you, I found that Ken brought an interesting topic to the table. The idea of waiting around for the rest of the world and other countries to be ready to fight climate change is not good practice. This idea in particular was what actually motivated me to go vegetarian for the first time in my life, hoping to reduce my carbon footprint. I think the principle of starting with ourselves is not only beneficial to us, but to the air we breath, other countries feeling the wrath of our actions, and the world in general. 
<br><br>
Although you brought up a good point when reviewing the other side of the argument, I would probably have to disagree with the position you took. Although it might be more difficult to fight for a cause that is an uphill battle, regulation and policy change can still be encouraged through more individuals standing against climate change. I would agree that without the support of policy and regulations it would be so much more difficult to create more solutions. Although this is true, I would encourage the idea that it takes more and more people to not wait around for everyone else that encourages politicians/leaders/lawmakers to create better policies. Although it might be hard, its something that we cant stop fighting for. This world is the only one that we have, and to just sit around and wait for people is not ethical, moral, or smart.

On paper, having a climate vanguard would be great. It's effects would be great, and would be an effective way to curb climate change and future and present causes. The problem with this, is that it is ideal at best, and near impossible at worse. I doubt the American people would receive this to keenly. Most of the population are either ignorant or just don't care about the climate crisis. This in turn would make the passing of legislation nigh impossible. 
<br><br>
It would only fix very little of the problem. It is still important to remain optimistic though. Despite its small chance of great success, it is important that we try everything in our power to curb the effects of climate change.

<p>
To the question, “Do we need climate vanguard?” I would definitely respond with yes. No one will ever be 100% on board with changing their daily habits, people today are still questioning the validity of climate change. In order to make a real change in our greenhouse gas emissions, we will need to take action today and have a strong group of leaders showing the everyday person the way to a sustainable life. Carbon taxes will be a valuable asset to the future of our climate and will significantly decrease Co2 emissions through the power of government and money. Although it will be a hard thing to come to terms with in our selfish American culture, flying will have to be limited. More people need to vow to limit their flying habits very soon or the detrimental effects it has on our climate will only get worse. I think Denmark's idea of adding climate labels to food is a genius idea because it will show people the over societal price they are having when buying certain foods. I believe most people are ignorant to the facts of the effects their eating habits have on our climate, so having the food labeled will make it impossible to ignore. All of these changes will only occur if a climate vanguard is in full effect and makes these ideas a reality.

I would one hundred percent agree with you that we need I climate vanguard, as Ken called it.  We need a strong social movement for the mitigation of climate change and I would add that we need a leader, or group of leaders to lead the charge. This is one thing that other movements have had, that I think the green movement desperately needs. A leader or leaders could give environmentalism and climate justice more direction and clearer demands for policy and consumption.
 <br><br>
Growing up in the Bay Area I got to see the successes and failures that came from the Occupy Wall Street movement first hand. I was impressed by the widespread and committed activism I saw within my community, and that took place over many months. But I think many of the movements flaws and shortcomings could have been prevented by a motivated leader. Often I have this same thought about the collective social movement pushing for the mitigation of future damage to our planet's climate. I’m hoping that the figure or figures that assume this role will be people from my generation, or even my peers. Because at this point it's clear, at least from my perspective, that the changes we need won’t come from the people in power right now, they will come from political and social pressure from the citizens of our country.
<br><br>
 That being said, I will still practice and encourage my friends to practice climate friendly behavior. So that decades down the line when we recognize our past mistakes, I will know that I was doing the right thing. In that way I will be a small part of the “climate vanguard”.

Watching this lecture I once again had to re-evaluate my meat inclusive diet. I must really wean myself off animal products. On a different note though, I like the idea of putting labels on food to show how environmentally bad each product was. I feel like it would really help make a difference for people who were trying to eat more plant based diets to help the environment because what is the point in not eating meat if the vegetable one is consuming is more environmentally disastrous than meat. Hopefully that movement does spread to the U.S. because it could make a difference in consumer purchases.

Also, Professor Ken mentioned a “climate vanguard” and it seemed like a fair amount of individuals were displeased with this wording. This made me think perhaps I had a different definition than everyone else so I looked it up, vanguard: “a group of people leading the way in new developments or ideas or a position at the forefront of new developments or ideas” (google dictionary). While it may sound like Prof. Ken is being mildly sanctimonious when he includes himself in the “climate vanguard”, I don’t think it necessarily deserves censure. We do need more people to lead the way environmentally and work to find better ways to live, and one could argue that Prof. Ken is someone who does actively try to find ways to help reduce our

Just like you I re-evaluated the amount of meat that I consume. There are restaurants that are revolved around meat consumption. For example Korenan Barbeque restaurants have grills that are built in your table so you can cook your own meat. Numerous amounts of trays are used in each seating because people try to get a bang for their buck. The thing about these restaurants is  that they are mostly all you can eat and they are a popular style of restaurant to go to. 
<br><br>


 Even though adding labels on food products to show how bad they are to our environment sounds like a good idea, I don’t think that it will make a difference because people don’t usually inspect the product and read the labels on it other than the expiration date. Unless the label is huge and isn’t a few small words on the side of a can I don’t see it working. When has the label that resturants tape to their doors stating that some of their products may cause cancer ever stopped someone from entering the restaurant. This is people’s own bodies we are talking about. People see that sign and know that there might be something in their food that may cause cancer but they continue to eat there. If people don’t care about their own body, their home (Earth) is something that they are less worried about and care about. We won’t know if labels of food will work until we try them.

It was nice to hear Ken mention that one's culture plays a significant role in what kind of food and how it is consumed. While Korean cuisine is largely plant-based and centered around harmony among the dishes set on a table, meat consumption is also somewhat idolized and favored as a sign of affluence, similar to how things are in the U.S. The decision to eat certain kinds of food affect one's climate footprint, but I strongly believe that, in terms of food consumption, food waste must be addressed first and foremost. I come from a household where I was reprimanded for even leaving a few grains of rice in my bowl so insuring that all the food made was consumed has become something of a lifestyle for me. To my knowledge, one of the most effective means of incentivizing anyone to do anything is when money is involved. I would imagine that a tax on waste production may be feasible to a certain extent.

Speaking of diets from the future, I think we are already seeing what the future American diet may look like. Over the past few decades the vegan diet has become more and more popular, especially in affluent areas like Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In any grocery store in my area, I can go inside and find at least a few high quality meat substitutes. As these become more and more popularized, they will become available in more places. This is what I see as the future American diet. I really like what Denmark is doing with the climate labels. I think people would be more willing to make choices that are good for the environment if the information is readily available on the product they are considering buying. I hadn't even thought about the fact that some vegetables are only grown in certain regions, but of course their transportation would have a significant impact. When we eat plants that are out of season, we aren't really doing our part as environmentalists. 

<br><br>

As for "sweeping climate action" I think we cannot afford to wait for everyone to be on board. Most people are only concerned with their day-to-day lives, and do not spend much time thinking critically about our culture and what they can do to change it. When we make laws and change the structure of the system in which they live, they will change accordingly, although surely not without some growing pains.

I never considered what my eating habits were doing for the environment until starting college. I never would have guessed that my massive meat intake, over eating, and throwing away unfinished food had anything to do with climate change. I think meat eating cultures have to be willing to make the sacrifice of not eating as much meat in order to make meaningful change. In the United States, it is very difficult to eat locally if you can't afford it. That being said, in order for local eating to overtake imported foods sold at chain supermarkets, the U.S.'s income inequality must be addressed first. Successful climate change mitigation appears to cost a lot of money-money that a majority of Americans can't contribute and live comfortably lives while the top 1% bathe in their money pools. American economic policies must be fixed first before citizens can afford to make the lifestyle changes necessary to stop climate change. Capitalism must be abolished.

“It is not too late to act. It will take a far-reaching vision, it will take courage, it will take fierce, fierce determination to act now, to lay the foundations where we might not know all the details about how to shape the ceiling. In other words, it will take cathedral thinking. I ask you to please wake up and make changes required possible.”
<br><br>

This was spoken at the European parliament’s environmental committee last April by someone I consider to be a climate vanguard: Greta Thunberg. She has pioneered a new wave of thinking, sparked and fueled a green movement among youths, and stands as a representative for the planet itself, all before the age of 17. She traveled by sailboat across the Atlantic Ocean to attend a global warming conference in the United States, and while there will always be flak about her methods, I believe the trip’s greatest success was raising awareness. Greta Thunberg’s “cathedral thinking” is that of an architect of the future. The very least we can do is start making the small changes, but we need to think bigger and do better.
<br><br>

The point I am trying to make, and Ken too, is that there will always be early adopters that ultimately embrace the future before it becomes irrefutably clear there is no alternative. These trailblazers have the unlimited potential to shape the world in whatever way they see fit, testing and trying, experimenting, breaking and rebelling against societal and institutional norms, cultivating and creating. I could see no better way to go about living; there is always room for improvement, and it truly begins within oneself. Yes, we do need a climate vanguard, and there arguably is already one in the making that we should be a part of.

Based on the past couple of lecture videos, it's obvious that the two main actions we can partake in is politics and personal change. I completely about voting for politicians who are not in denial about the climate change and actually want to help the young generation save this planet. Because as mentioned before, the people that caused this crisis are still in power and it's going to be a while until my generation can be involved in congress and by then it most likely will be too late so it's important to vote for the right politicians. And there should be no excuses to not voting because at the Arbor and everywhere (as a matter of fact just the other day a girl actually came up to my dorm and knocked on my door to make sure I am registered to vote) so it's not hard to register to vote. 
<br><br>
Moreover, I do believe that in order to change the climate crisis we need to first start change within our own lives.we cannot control someone else's life but we can control ours, so I am going to do my part as best to my abilities. As a matter of fact, I started consuming less and less meat since fall quarter when we first talked about the meat industry in English 22. I am not vegetarian nor vegan (frankly my culture will not let me lol too many good dishes) but since I know the couple of times I go home I will be consuming meat, I try not to eat meat while being here at UCSB for 3 months period. And even when I go home I do not consume meat every single day; at this point my body has gotten use to the plant based diet and now when I eat meat I feel a little disgusted with myself. And the combination of eating healthy and going to the gym has made me feel so much better and I am at my happiest right now.

I wish I could stop flying... but I can't. I love traveling, learning about new cultures, and seeing other parts of the world. I wish that there were electric planes, so I would not have to contribute to the carbon emissions in the atmosphere. I wish there were more high-speed railways, including underwater, intercontinental railways. I would in theory support a carbon tax, but I feel that a carbon tax may disproportionately hurt lower income people. There is unfortunately privilege in being able to be sustainable and environmental. The irony in that rich people are those who contribute most to the climate crisis, but are the most accessible to living sustainabley, and healthily, which can be very pricey.

I agree with what you said. As an international student, I can not take a train to the US, or talk to my friends or parents just with a smartphone. As human beings are emotional creatures, we have to have some face to face contact with people we care about. As you said, if public transportation becomes more efficient and environmental-friendly in the future, I would take public transportation instead of driving.

<br><hr>
Yea I get your point. It is hard to cut stuff like flying and driving out. Especially when there aren't really any feasible alternatives. In order for real change to happen there needs to be infrastructure put in place so that the masses have real, environmentally friendly options. At this moment in time the alternative to flying is not traveling at all across seas. Likewise the alternative to driving (if there is no public transportation available) is carpooling which may not always be convenient as you have to find someone with the same schedule as you and is willing to commute with you. You make a good point that at the moment, being environmentally friendly is a privilege for those who are wealthy enough to afford conscientious efforts to live sustainably
<br><hr>
I agree with this a lot especially your take on how a carbon tax would disproportionately hurt lower-income people. It is a shame like you said that the people most responsible for the climate crisis are also the most accessible to living sustainably. To me, this is a huge societal issue in desperate need of fixing. There is literally a way to estimate a community's income based on how many pizza places are within a certain area. When it comes to sustainability, the poor of America simply can't afford to live a sustainable lifestyle. To people already living paycheck to paycheck, something like a carbon tax would just make matters worse for them. I believe a massive change in fast cheap food is necessary to combat the climate crisis. If our government finds a way to make sustainable eating and living accessible to all people while also preventing fast food from taking over poor neighborhoods, then our future will be saved... to an extent

<br><hr>
Right, the whole Greta Thunberg "we do or we don't" is hard for me to figure out and I sometimes wish it wasn't voluntary and someone just forced me to save the planet because so many things I love are contributing to the crisis and my will is weak. I never fly honestly but driving and commuting from my hometown and to work (which is 20 minutes away) is a must as of now. I can't lie though, Ken's commitment is inspiring with the experimenting on ways to interact with the world online and all. I hope to be on his level of commitment one day and enjoy it. I also wish we could put indicators on groceries like they mentioned that provide necessary climate info.
<br><hr>
I respect the fact that your comment is very honest and to the point. I too am unsettled on the flying issue that was addressed last week and was also brought up again this week. I also agree that the carbon tax could be a potential issue for low income people and families. Although, I don't think I know enough about the fundamentals of what the carbon tax would actually look like and the exact numbers or ways it would effect the everyday life of the average American. I am eager to learn more about the carbon tax in future lectures. Your statement I agree the most with is, "There is unfortunately privilege in being able to be sustainable and environmental." I myself have been trying to slowly switch to a plant-based diet. But as a full time student athlete, without a job, it has been difficult to do so when it comes buying groceries. I am now realizing that the main reason why have been so successful is because of my easy access to the school's, in a sense, "free" dining commons. Next year I will be living off campus in Isla Vista and will most likely have to make the majority of my meals at home. This means regular trips to the grocery store to restock my fridge with the necessary items to fulfill my plant-based diet. Now I know for a fact that "organic", "grass-fed", and vegan or vegetarian food products are more expensive than a traditional college diet of ramen noodles and Mac and cheese. This does worry me and I believe it supports your statement that privilege, and in most cases, money, makes being environmental much easier. I also think your point that the rich are the ones who are contributing most to the climate crisis, is very important to note. Even though this week's film, Cowspiracy, and this week's lecture video are fairly convincing when it comes to reasons why we should switch to a plant-based diet, we cannot be blind to the obstacles we may face when attempting to make this change, especially if we want to make it nationwide.

To respond to the question that Ken raised at the end of the lecture video, I will say we’d better wait until others realize how important it is to protect our environment. Since if people cannot work together, we could never make it better with only a few vanguards. Connecting to this week’s film, we can see that even if some people tried their best to save water while showering, the amount of water wasted in only eating one hamburger can account for the amount of water for showering for two and a half months. So if it’s not all humankind come together, the problem can never been solved with only a small amount of people’s efforts.

<br><br>


 Besides, in the lecture video, Ken has brought up an idea that we can put a climate label to all kinds of food to tell good whether the one is good or not for our climate. I don’t think it can really work to help people to protect our environment. Since the largest amount of resource waste is when all kinds of food are in the production process, once all of products have already come into the market, it doesn’t matter if it is good to our environment or not. All the water and other resources have already been wasted, and all the greenhouse gases have already been released into the atmosphere already. If consumers don’t buy all the products because they think those are harmful to the environment, it will, in turn, increase the amount of waste food, which add more the wasted food amount, harming our environment deeply. The only way to solve the problem is to reduce the amount of raising livestocks to cut the carbon footprints for everyone of us. It only makes sense to cut the origin of the production line. I hope Ken can answer this question in next week’s lecture.

I'm gonna have to disagree with you here. No good will come from waiting around. Yes, although it sucks that even though you are trying your best and help the environment while other people are out killing it may cause despair, but that should not stop you from doing what you think is correct. Yes, the problem can not be solved with only the minority, but it would be much worse if no one was willing to do anything. Instead of waiting for the world to change, I think we should help it change, putting progress into it by voting, changing our diets, take shorter showers, and influence others as well. Like Gandhi said: "Be the change you want to see in the world". Being idle isn't gonna help. To your second point, I think it is good that we should put climate labels on food products to show the carbon emissions. Yes, it is true that people might be discouraged to buy those products, but isn't that the whole point? To stop people from buying meat or products that need air transportation? Maybe those products themselves might be thrown away and become waste but because of people not buying, those producers will stop making those products because they aren't appealing to the people anymore. That is the only way that we can cut the origin on the production line; no politician will be able to stop people from eating meat.

There are a few points that Ken brought up in this lecture that I found incredibly interesting. I think once again that my family lives very very far away from me, and I genuinely couldn't imagine a world where I wasn't able to see them once every two years if that's the only air travel I do. I try to do my part, I rideshare back to the Bay Area and almost never step foot in my car now that I'm a full time student here, but I don't think I can give up flying and that's something that won't change anytime soon. In addition, this idea that Ken has been repeatedly mentioning throughout the course is that those who are less fortunate are suffering more because of the actions of those who are more privileged. Every time I go to India, we always have a few nights where, after religious events, we ask every single person in the village my dad grew up in to come and eat a meal mass produced by my family. There are never left overs. Ever. This, in comparison to every single night my family spends in India, where somebody either cooks way too much food, or the lentils have way too much salt in them, and then at that point, we give this food to the people who come around everyday to get wasted food as food for the cows that they milk on their farm. While it's not a perfect system, it ensures that not even a drop of waste is occurring. I think that the reason America's problem regarding climate change and fossil fuels has increased so much is due to the entitlement and privilege that every single American harbors in their heart. They find it difficult to even fathom compromising on the American Dream and its frustrating because pride is more important than the future of our planet.

<p>
After watching Ken’s lecture videos I have realized that even though it seems that when we make changes in our personal lives to improve the effects of climate change have little to no effect on the the overall disaster at hand, they truly do. We, as educated and informed adults on the climate crisis, have to lead by example and spread our knowledge if we hope to maintain human life on this planet. We can start by flying less or not at all, biking and walking instead of driving, not buying from fast fashion corporations, eating less meat, and buying less consumer goods. These may seem very small and difficult to incorporate but the action is needed and contributes to global change even if you do not see immediate results. We must let go of this idea of toxic consumerism and expressing ourselves through the idea of wealth and spread the idea of prosperity and longevity over instant gratification of unnecessary purchases that create the illusion of happiness. We must focus on the greater good which is saving this planet, one less purchase at a time.

I agree with you like yeah we are trying to improve climate change but our contribution is almost meaningless unless a majority change their lifestyle. I feel the best approach to the issue at hand is to inform people especially the younger generations. We and many other adults have the biggest influence to help improve climate change but we just don't do it and when the time comes when it is already too late, we are gonna regret the consequences. Lowering consumer consumption, eating less meat, and drifting away from driving can drastically reduce carbon emissions but people's strive for "more" is masking the ideology of minimalism. People should adapt to minimalism because it will help them live a better lifestyle and hopefully realize the true reality of life and happiness.
<br><hr>
I agree that as individuals we need to take the steps and change our behaviors especially our food behaviors at the dinner table fist. But I do believe that there are stubborn people out there who might refuse to change their habits so in response to professor Hiltner’s question, we quite possibly need a climate vanguard, someone who can advocate for plant-based diets at the government level. I also agree with you that people need to change their habits of flying less and not buying from fast fashion companies and turning away from cars and instead using public transportation and bikes, but since meat consumption and the beef industry are the leading cause of the climate crisis and that their methane emissions are worse than carbon dioxide emissions I feel like as activists we need to do everything in our power to change our ways because up to this point humans have been acting selfishly in our own interests, but we are not the one species that inhabit this planet. We HAVE to think about all the other incredible species and future generations when it comes to our actions that affect and/or worsen the climate crisis. To reiterate my point again, yes I do agree with you that individual action is needed even though it might feel like it doesn't do much right now, but specifically talking about the United States we need to take individual action one step further and have a climate vanguard, someone who can change the institution and get the government to gradually turn away from beef and dairy consumption because we can still get the same nutrients from a plant-based diet.

I feel like the points you raise are very important. First with the cultural patterns we are largely born into. As a Mexican-American, I feel that much of my diet has emphasized the role meat diets have within society. If I were to say attend a family event much of the food I encounter, (depending on what is offered) would likely be meat and or animal based. Including foods such as tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas or even chilli rellenos. Given the cemented stance of the beef industry overall, it would take a significant change of mind in order to begin to alter some foods, but not overwhelmingly so. As options such as veganism, pescatarianism, and vegetarianism have expanded,  the awareness people have with their food has expanded as well. As you've brought up, the idea of 'indulging in your heritage,' while emphasizing some food groups, it's still important to be able to have altered or relatively decreased amounts of animal focused foods. With everyone 'trying their best' to cut down on animal based foods within their own lives, be consciously aware and taking steps to reduce the reliance we have on these foods could make a great impact.
<br><br>
The emphasis we place upon labels, including eating practices can have a negative impact on how people view themselves as well. With the push Ken proposes of a higher plant based diet, does not necessarily exclude all meat entirely, but a reduced intake helps both the planet, and can be substantially better for one's health. A great place to start I feel could be local, and specifically right here at home at UCSB. In regard to the practices and meals prepared by the dining commons.

To answer Ken’s question, I think we need a vanguard, we should begin acting now. I don’t think we should wait until everyone is on board for sweeping climate action because the truth is everyone may never be full on board. The truth is, some people need to be encouraged and inspired through other people’s actions because they want to be able to see that it’s possible to live a happy fulfilling life without damaging the planet to the extent we are now. 
  <br><br>
  If I am understanding the carbon tax correctly, it would implement a tax based on the usage of carbon. The lecture video mentions that the carbon tax would increase over time, would this be because of inflation or another reason? Although this lecture video discussed how we should elect those into office who are looking to address our environmental issues, we forget our individual power to help create change. For example, we have the ability to waste far less food and switch to larger plant based diets. When I went to Dominican Republic, some of the locals did not even know what vegetarian meant, they often thought it just meant that person only ate vegetables and they thought that eating fish was considered vegetarian. It’s important for us to note and remember that some places there is a correlation between food and culture. For instance, some think that not eating meat would be disrespectful. However, for some places the lack of meat is a part of their culture. For example, the mediterranean diet hardly has meat in it. One of the coolest ideas I ever heard was from Denmark, which was to put carbon labels the same way we have nutrition labels.

<p>
I believe that we do need a climate vanguard. With all of the information that I have received through this class, I now know that we need to act and act fast. We need more and more people to take part in this global issue and help catalyze some political change in terms of climate change. Although we have many people that are so-called the faces of this movement, for example, Greta Thunberg, she can’t do it alone. More people need to band together and let people know how pressing an issue climate change really is.
   <br><br>

I think it might be hard to get everyone on board because many are not feeling the direct effects of climate change, but with more attention from the media about the real causes and effects could really motivate people to go out and make a change. 
   <br><br>

Denmark is remarkable for setting these environmental precedents for the rest of the world. They are showing the planet that it is possible to make a difference in the environment at a very little cost. I hope proactive countries like Denmark can really inspire the rest of the world to become active against the fight with climate change.

Often when we talk about environmental issues and solutions, it always seems like comparing two are in a dichotomy. But if we were to look at issues and solutions in a more holistic, integrative sense, we can find that we are able to revolutionize this movement in a multitude of ways. Why only limit yourself to personal actions or structural change when we can have both that propels this movement even farther than if we only focused on one over the other. 
   <br><br>

Looking at structural change, this course has suggested that we can create fundamental change to our system by voting for people who will put in a carbon tax and such. But isn’t this individual action that is influencing a large overhaul of our system? This is where I see the two ends of the spectrum of solutions being greatly intertwined. I will note however, that a lot of skepticism comes from the fact that the biggest influencers of structural changes are the ones who have an economic stake in keeping business as usual such as fossil fuel executives and lobbyists and well, Republicans. So yes, we need to be climate vanguards because structural change will be very difficult if we don’t have those climate vanguards leading their lifestyles by example while pushing for this structural change.

I feel as though diet has been a large part of my life for many years as I obsessed over "fat burning" foods, foods that would clear my skin, and whatever else I read on some dumb article online as a teenager. I went through phases of veganism and vegetarianism throughout high school and struggled with nutrition through this as well. I now eat mostly a plant based diet, but I do eat eggs, chicken, turkey, and some cheese from time to time. I hope some day I have the means and the bank account to afford to be fully vegan, but for now my priority is eating enough protein. After this week's lecture I have realized that I should not have to feel bad about choosing my health over veganism, because I have other options to fix my diet. Instead of restricting what I eat, I should instead watch more of how much food I can eat. This means paying better attention to portions I eat and being more mindful of the food waste I produce. I tend to get very hungry and order more food than I will eat at a restaurant, or grab more plates at the dining halls than I need, or the classic case of having eyes bigger than my stomach. I feel bad about wasting food and now that I am more aware of how much food we waste as a country, I want to do my part to not contribute as much. At the dining hall, practicing this is easy.  Everyone at UCSB can do their part by taking one plate or serving of food at a time and not returning to pick up another until they have finished the previous one. I want to practice this for a week and see just how often I return completely empty dishes.

I completely agree. There are more options to help the environment through what you eat than just being vegan. Although a plant based diet is really great, minimizing food waste is the greatest way to be climate friendly. I completely agree that I will now pay attention to the portions of food I eat and make sure I don't make or buy too much food that I won't eat. 
   <br><br>

Also, Ken explains perfectly the idea that we need to elect politicians who will enact a carbon tax, and push for changes combating climate change. Ken’s “travel free conference” is a great idea to implement all over. So many times I have heard my friends parents talking about flying in and out somewhere on the same day or in two days just to go to a single conference. That is so crazy for me to fathom. Why haven’t we made virtual meetings mainstream yet? It is a simple and smart solution to the many problems that come with flying to national or international conferences. 
   <br><br>

It is shocking to see how much food is wasted in the dining halls. When I go to put my plates on the trays to be cleaned, I see left over food on almost every plate. It confuses me every time, because so much is wasted, and I wonder why people don't just choose not to get it. I am so disappointed in the UCSB community for not addressing the fact that we ourselves are contributing greatly to the climate crisis through food waste. I think that we should urge people to not waste as much food in the dining halls. This is a simple and easy to help curb the climate crisis. It takes basically no lifestyle change or effort.

In this lecture, Ken mentions another lifestyle change that we can
switch to, to make the situation to be better. Ken claims that the American
people’s diet mainly based on meat and it is a big part of the culture, so it is
hard to become a plant-based diet for the people. Moreover, this lecture also gives
some possible solutions to overcome the challenges posed by climate
change. More specifically, it focuses on food waste and how can it lead to
further influences.

Kudos to you Ken that you stopped flying, I highly respect that. I always aim to in theory but have yet to actually put that into practice. I did not know that many professors double or triple their carbon footprint with air travel to conferences, that is a huge impact for people to share academic information, that sometimes (in Ken’s case) is on sustainability.
   <br><br>
I think it's an important fact to think about what our ancestors ate. Yes we as humans have always hunted and eaten animals, however it was very different in our history, because there were so many less humans inhabiting the environment. Also, our modern day diets are way more meat heavy than ever before, especially in the US. Beef is insanely popular in the US as you mentioned, more than anywhere else. United Statesians order 15 oz steaks and eat them by themselves. That is horrible for their health, and obviously horrible for the environment.

I like that you gave Ken props for giving up flying because I thought that as well considering it's something a lot of people will be scared of doing (me included). I've only ever flown twice and I hope of traveling to so many places but after all of what Ken has taught us so far, I don't think i see myself doing that without feeling guilty (as those who fly should). I think that him mentioning alternatives like more virtual conferences for professional reasons to fly is great. More virtual conferences is something very important to due consideration we have those tools to do so like Skype, Conference Calls etc. For people to at least consider doing that is a step forward towards less flying. 
   <br><br>
In terms of what food we eat, it's complicated because of culture. My culture is based on eating a lot of meat, and therefore it makes it that much harder. For me, I started eating less meat and became vegetarian for a while due to English 22. But when I would go home it was so hard for me to stick to that because all my family eats is meat, chicken, and pork. I like to think that me eating less meat has definitely rubbed off on them, and they have accepted that and stop forcing me to eat meat when I do come home. They even started to drink almond milk and order dishes without meat when we go out to eat considering our culture.

The fact that we even have to ask the question about when we do we need to start this change for the betterment of the planet is completely mind bogging and shows how shameless, insensitive, and greedy we are. It's completely evident that we must change our ways now. And yes I know it might be her , but if we want change we must sacrifice. The condition of this world we are in is down-right deplorable and I'm not sure if we are just ignorant or truly oblivious. I know I have made many changes to my lifestyle in order to better my lifestyle and the planet. Little by little we must all change, we must change now so the effects won't be as drastic as they possibly can for when they actually begin to globally affect us. 
   <br><br>
One of the major solutions we have that will critical in the betterment of the planet's health, is how and what we eat. I was actually intrigued by the certain factors that must take into consideration when we eat, like where the plants are grown, their water intake, whether they are flown in or not, and much more. It was interesting to know that some diets that only include one meal a day with animal product were less green-house gas intensive than complete lacto-ovo vegetarian diets; which is very ironic considering that we have been told that one of the main solutions to our green house gas epidemic has been food and that going vegetarian has been one of the best solutions, and of course having a much more larger plant-based diets is on he right track, there are some guideline that will help us truly get the best out of this solution. But personally, I do believe that one of the best solutions tat we have and should start not only engaging but enforcing is our diets, and sure it will be difficult because the US is complete melting pot of cultures and food is what truly helps define many cultures, but it is something that must be done. We will succeed through our bellies.

I do think it’s a little much to say exactly this about us being greedy and what not completely. While I do agree we should rethink what we eat, waste less foods, and have a larger plant based diet, the idea of not eating meat as a whole entire planet is very difficult. The ways that we have evolved as human beings over time gives us a very good insight of why hunter gatherers were the only way to survive in some areas of the world. This being said, the mass production of meat being beef is relatively absurd and mind boggling. The food idea presented of all becoming vegan is a good idea, as most people have already changed their eating habits to this. But, this problem of not having very evolved plant based food that isn’t processed is a difficult boundary to hurdle. I personally love to eat meat and beef especially, with that being said I’d love still love to eat a larger plant based diet as long as we can fix this problem of taste and indulgence. I know I will change this and have already started consuming less meat overall to help in some ways on this aspect of change.

My mother did this exactly. When i came home and picked through my pasta to avoid the meat, and refused to eat the steak she made, she got mad. It wasn’t that that food went to waste (I have two brothers who probably ate it for lunch), it was that she felt like I was rejecting her culture. It took two years for her to finally stop making comments about my diet, and on a whole we decreased the amount of meat we ate as a family. For the individual choices such as these, I think everyone should begin now. It isn’t hard at the moment if you are at the dining hall to decrease your meat consumption, and since they are buying the food that if popular, I think it would actually be very easy to shift the variety of food to a more plant based diet. 
   <br><br>


Recently, one of the largest milk brands went bankrupt because of all the alternatives available such at oat milk and almond milk and soy milk. This shows that it is possible to control the markets with consumer demand, yet it is arguably much harder to stop drinking milk than it is to completely cut out meat. There are whole states who’s “thing” revolves around who can make the best ribs. The best way to combat how much meat is eaten is to implement carbon taxes on meat, which would drive the prices up and decrease the demand from them that comes from the simple fact that it may be cheaper to buy a slab of steak than to buy vegetables. 
   <br><br>


I don’t disagree about flying, and it may be the one area in which I feel most guilty about. Flying from NYC at least once a year adds a large dent to my carbon footprint, and forget about visiting my family in Spain. What really concerns me though is that a lot of cultural mingling comes from travel. It’s terrifying to think that the USA would become completely dissociated with the rest of the world. We already carry a large patriotic badge in our hearts which causes problems internally and in our relationships with the world. On a greater scale, the economy is so dependent on tourist traveling, that to completely stop would freeze hotspots all across the country. What would NYC look like without the hustle and bustle of the rest of the world traipsing down the streets? I think it could definitely be limited by an agreement to increase projects with high speed trains and maybe add a carbon tax to flyers that could help pay for it. All these solutions would be great if they didn't mess with big corporations, which means the likelihood of these plans being implemented without full scale government support is small.

My parents and extended family reacted similarly when I decided to go vegan as animal products have become an essential part of their daily lives after moving to America, and my choice conflicts with the dishes that are centered during any cultural celebrations or traditions. I agree that if anyone who wants to reduce their individual environmental impact has access to the dining commons, food is a good way to start as there are many plant based options available that they can consume instead.
<br><br>
While I agree that there should be carbon taxes on meat, it is also worth noting that the government provides subsidies that make meat--and other animal products--so affordable through our taxes, which contributes to an increase in both supply and demand. This is part of the reason why dairy and meat alternatives are not as competitively priced in the U.S. as they are in, say, the U.K.. I think there should be government policies that incentivize the production and consumption of less environmentally impactful foods.



<br><hr>
My mom would react the same exact way if I were to do that. I talked to her the other day and told her that I would want to commit to being at least vegetarian for right now and then possibly work my way up to veganism. The first thing she did was smack her lips and tell me that I need to stick to my culture and eat meat. I told my roommate that my mom’s not gonna be happy when I’m passing up offers of tacos and chicken next time I visit, and it was funny but it’s definitely true. I agree with you that it would be easier to start now. To be completely honest, most of my diet has been plant-based since coming to UCSB because the dining commons has so much variety, but at home it’s hard to turn down what my mom’s cooking (whether it be because of the taste or the fact that I don’t want to upset her),
<br><br>


I like the idea of a tax on meat but I think in poor communities, we need to focus on implementing healthy foods for reasonable prices. I’m not sure if everyone jokes about it, but back home my family is always joking about how the bad stuff is cheap but anything healthy is expensive and hard to get. It’s definitely some cheap non-meat foods out there, but sometimes that $1.10 burger is all they can get. Implementing more farmer’s markets or vegan shops in South Central LA or any other low income community could also be a great step up in raising meat prices because it’ll simultaneously force and encourage them to buy plant-based alternatives. And that of course applies to the general public as well.

<br><br>

I can’t really relate to the flying thing at the moment because I’ve never been on a plane, but I would love to travel the world someday so there’s a lot of conflict going on.I feel like flying is another thing that’s a big part of culture in terms of being able to travel in and outside of America.

Food waste is an issue I wasn’t educated enough on and it really surprises me how big of a problem it is. I have to admit I’ve been guilty of wasting food, but the extent to which food is wasted is alarming. This is something I see every single day, especially in places like restaurants as people don’t finish their food due to the great portions served. I also see food being wasted every day in the dining commons. The amount of food that is thrown away is unbelievable. In terms of changing my food diet to a plant based one is something I find a bit challenging. Coming from a hispanic heritage meat is part of our daily lives, some of my favorite foods are based on its use (pozole, birria, carnitas, tacos, etc.). It is a challenging decision for me to cut back on meat completely, but is something I can probably do at least once or twice a week to give it a start. On a worldwide level I don’t know how the public would be convinced to change this lifestyle. At least here in America, I can’t imagine people completely cutting off fast food place like McDonalds for instance from their lives. It’s just something I don’t see possible on a worldwide level. However, if little by little more people start cutting meat from their diet I see it as a great step forward to saving our planet. The time is now to start making changes, not until our planet is suffering more effects from our decisions.

While the concept of this "climate vanguard" sounds valid and even intriguing in its conceptual design, I doubt its capabilities to spark change throughout society. Society, in general, operates off of the opinion of the majority and it's these popular ideologies that become spread across the social and cultural divides and become normal in practice. The one I could see this vanguard working was if it was a highly influential group, of celebrities for example, who already have this influence to change their followers opinions despite the conformist pressure of the general societal beliefs. I believe that some type of leadership is required in the sense that the public needs to see that these environmentally friendly lifestyles are realistic and accessible instead of just a statistical suggestion that is too radical to be followed by anyone. If there was ever a need for a vanguard, the time would be now as there isn't much time left for the planet, in consideration to the climate crisis, to sit around and wait for the general public to come to these conclusions on their own. Humans are always in search for a sense of leadership or someone to help guide them through, and I believe this concept has potential to influence the climate change process towards greener practices. In terms of the overall topic of the lecture video, I found this proposition to be a lot more realistic. Changing the way we as humans consume our calories is an easy adjustment to our lifestyle compared to the radical idea of giving up cars, clothing and air travel. As Ken said, we need to implement a largely plant based diet which still allows for the consumption of meats on occasion. The one issue I have with this process though, is the fact that vegan and natural diets are often inaccessible to the lower classes because the appeal of fast food is more than just the convince but the cheapness of the product. If the agriculture business could make fresh products more accessible then I believe that dietary changes are good step towards the environmental changes required to ensure a sustainable future.

I have come to the same conclusion too! In order to have less waste and slow down climate change switching to a largely plant based diet would be best for everyone. And it can be a lot simpler than we tend to think. But we cannot ignore the fact that these plant based foods can be inaccessible or too expensive. We must have elected officials who care about this and press for systematic and economic change. Luckily I have ebt food stamps so I can afford to eat vegan, but that is not the case for a lot of people. But you’re right, this change can’t happen immediately. But in order for it to happen we need to start acting now by doing things like educating ourselves and others and by voting! Then we can get people in office who can do things like impose a  carbon tax. That’ll help the environment and make flying more expensive, among other things. The issue of climate change is intersectional so we must deal with it in many different approaches. 
<br><br>

I do like the idea of not wasting a single food scrap if you can. Sometimes I find myself wasting more food than I thought I would and I have to try and change my habits. By using a majority of the scraps of food we are wasting less, and you compost whatever we don’t want to eat or can’t eat. I’m going to try composting now in order to cut back on my waste too. The mess of the world is very big and it can make us unmotivated to take small action, but we can’t let that be in our way. We need to be our own climate vanguard in a sense, like you said, in order to hold yourself accountable and encourage others to do the same.  We can’t wait around for the rest of the world so we have to start talking and voting and making changes. We can’t stand for this anymore. We all deserve better.

It is very important that we start addressing and making changes to slow down climate change NOW. There are many changes individuals can make in order to slow down climate change. It was very admirable learning that Ken has stopped flying out to places because of the carbon emissions airplanes release. Deciding not to travel on an airplane takes a lot of courage and discipline. Individualistic changes as such can make a huge impact on our planet. We can start small and slowly progress to big changes like Ken’s. It was also very interesting that although animal production has a huge, negative effect on a global scale, simply going vegetarian does not help the environment much. Learning where your products come from and knowing the right time to purchase certain products is essential to helping the environment. Simple purchasing vegetables instead of meat does not help much if the vegetables were transported here, in which large carbon emissions were essentially released onto the environment. Taking measures to help slow down climate change are not easy, but certainly doable.

For the past 60 years, we have sat down and watched the environment deteriorate right before our eyes. For the environment to survive we can't keep up what we've been (or not) doing. That being said it is extremely difficult for us to make changes too our diets that could ensure that our carbon footprint is decreased dramatically. While it is understandable that making this kind of change requires an institutional and personal shift but knowing that our days on the earth are being reduced due to our impact on the environment constitutes a small change in our lifestyles. It's really frustrating how integral meat and dairy products have become to our whole society over a year of advertising and exponential growth.

I think it is really interesting that meat-rich diets were seen as a sign of affluence because today, a lot of the time I feel like switching to a plant based diet would be more expensive. Fresh produce is often not very cheap, and a lot of people turn to unhealthy and meat-rich fast foods if they do not want to spend a lot of money on a meal and are too lazy to make something. Of course, steak and fancy seafood at a nice restaurant would be the very expensive items, but in day to day life I think that fast food is a bigger problem in increasing our meat consumption. 
<br><br>
I liked what Ken said about how anyone can become an architect of the future by changing their diet and food waste. It is really important to show people that they can make a difference on their own and things are not hopeless just because the government and industry are not doing what needs to be done to combat the climate crisis. I also thought it was interesting that Ken noted how eating asparagus in the winter is just as bad as eating meat because it has to be flown in. I had not thought too much about all the implications of what we eat and how just changing what you eat is not always enough because you have to take other aspects into account like where the food is coming from and how it is grown.

<p>
In Ken’s video “Do we need a climate vanguard? (Food, today, and tomorrow)”, it stood out to me finally the reason this was posing to be such a problem to address. For many people, the things we eat and the way we eat is very personal to us, to our families, and even to our cultures and religions. I don’t think this issue should be avoided as it has been by env. orgs. therefore, but I also think that we need to be understanding of these importances and make room for them. We have to find ways to integrate a plant-based diet into our cultures.
<br><br>

In addition, this video brought up several questions for me. First, how does the transportation of foods factor into what we should or should not be eating? I think that buying locally seems to be the best thing for the environment, but our world has changed so much that the local produce you can find are sometimes mainly mono crops in certain areas, or are not even sold locally and are often exported. I was thinking about this as you brought up a classic Italian diet as containing many vegetables, but many of those vegetables were not introduced until post-colonial times. Our ability to transport foods has given us a lot of variety that we take for granted, but I guess what I am trying to say here, is how sustainable is that variety? Should we return to having regional-based diets, varying on what can be grown nearby? I’m interested to know… Another question this video brought to my mind dealt with the large wage and living disparities in our society and our world today. With food, for example, it is cheaper to buy a patty from McDonald’s than a salad from just about anywhere. I was wondering how we could ask about a climate vanguard when our society works on a sliding scale. Life is meant to make things easier for the rich and harder for the poor. For example, people who are in the upper classes it is easier to make this shift to a healthier, greener diet, but for some that is financially harder. I think we do need a climate vanguard, but I don’t think it’s good enough to just change because not all of us can. We have to change the system so that we can bring everyone else up with us. We have to make these healthy and vegan options more readily available, and we have to tax meat and dairy produce.

i agree our food consuption is such a big deal, we waste so much and it costs the planet so much to make this food. Because i work at a grocery store it is so easy for me to see how much food is not used. I work at a local eco friendly grocery store so i can easily see how big coorporations would get ride of expired but certainly good food. The store i work at gives away to the workers the unwanted food and compostes but big coorps dont do that . I think the concept of free-gan is a very good idea because there is so much good food that goes to waste.

I really enjoyed the straightforward intense message and tone Ken set for the lecture at the beginning. I feel like in today’s state of inevitable climate emergency, we must encourage people to take action in precisely that way: harsh and honest. Greta’s assertion to either “do something or not” is a perfect way to describe the present. We cannot wait any longer if we want to mitigate the crisis in the most effective way possible. Following that initial wake-up call, the most interesting concept to me discussed here was the massive blockade to converting to a plant-based diet, due to the structure of our society and lifestyle. Ken highlighted, “this is easier said than done, as the way that we eat is somewhat paradoxically deeply personal and almost always a shared experience”. Acknowledging that food is a keystone part of any culture, I still feel like consumerism has taken food’s prevalence and people’s preferences for it to the maximum level.
<br><br>
I think back to the numerous hang out days I have shared with friends, family-even people I am meeting for the first time, and how food was almost always the main attraction. For instance, when my best friend and I just drive around town, we usually go to a restaurant with heaping portions of food typically containing meat. In between that and Target trips where we purchase useless disposable things, we might pick up a dairy-filled milkshake from McDonalds. Being a climate solution proponent, I never tried on a different perspective and uncovered my own wasteful patterns. Because food was just built into my social life, I could not see the reckless decisions I was making. Quantifying the plastic cups, tossed leftovers, take-out boxes, pointless knick-knacks, and untouched beef, I feel ashamed.

I totally agree with what you said about food being a social thing, something that Ken mentioned in this lecture as well. I didn't even realize that on most occasions that I meet up with my friends, it pretty much always involves food. I can't remember the last time I asked someone to just go for a walk in the park or watch a movie together. I almost always meet up for lunch or grab dinner with my friend, and most of the time I don't make the most healthy or ecofriendly choices when it comes to what I order. I think food is so deeply integrated into our social life that we don't focus on the meal itself anymore, but rather see it as a "by-product" of meeting up with friends and family. After all, I have to eat at least twice a day anyway, so why not combine it with spending time with someone I love? We have such an impersonal and detached relationship with our food that we don't even realize the unhealthy and unethical choices we are making. What's always so interesting to me, is that I have no problem cutting out meat or choosing not to eat dairy products when I'm at home. But whenever I'm eating out at a restaurant or ordering food from somewhere, I almost never make those same healthy choices. One of the reasons is probably that most restaurants have only limited vegetarian options and barely any vegan options that aren't just salad. Although I love salad, I often find myself not really seeing the point in ordering a salad when I'm already spending money to eat out. Instead, I see all the amazing other meal options they have - almost all of them including meat or at least some other animal product. Then I almost feel like it would be a waste to "just" eat a salad cause I might as well just make that at home.
<br><br>
What I'm trying to say is that, of course, we make our own choices regarding food, but since it is such a big part of our social life - and will probably continue to be - it is not only just up to us what we eat. Whenever I tell my dad - who loves cooking, especially cooking meat - that I don't want to eat lamb or chicken or salmon, he always gets really upset or disappointed. So then I feel guilty and end up eating it anyway because I don't want him to feel like I don't appreciate what he cooks. The same thing applies to restaurants - if I just order a salad, which is often one of the only vegetarian choices, I'm always asked why I don't order something "better" or "more special". I think it's really sad that most restaurants don't view vegetarian or vegan dishes as a priority and I believe that examples like this are one of the reasons why most people regard it as so difficult to switch to a largely plant-based diet. Eating meat and animal products is such a huge part of our culture - and almost a societal expectation - that I often find it really hard to go against that. If there were more vegan or vegetarian options out there, then maybe it wouldn't feel like we have to "give up" something.

After watching this lecture video, I have learned more about what we can do in our daily lifestyle to reduce climate change. One point that I never would know in the past is that when professor said that being a vegan can sometimes do more harm to the environment than those who consume meat in lives. This is confused when I first heard it, but after I heard the explain by professor, I suddenly realized that there are things that we need to care about. First is where the food and clothes come from, like what the clothes made from, or where are these plants from. These things do matter because these can affect the climate change by the materials they made from. Moreover, being a vegan is a better and a healthier lifestyle, and it has being testify by scientists. With eating vegetables, it can provide a large amount of vitamins and nutrients that we need, and these are the nutrients we can get from meat. Furthermore, my mom told me once that while the animals are killed, they will generate some toxic elements in their bodies, and this is because of hate. While we consume these toxins day by day, we may ill in different ways, and shorten our lifespan.

Yes, I can see why it was confusing at first to hear that eating some vegetables can be as harmful to the environment as eating meat. When out-of-season produce is being made available in stores, it uses a substantial amount of carbon. What your mom said about eating animals is a very interesting point that I haven’t heard before. I’m glad you both can accept eating plant-based and find it beneficial. 
<br><br>

Ken said that declaring veganism or vegetarianism at home can be a problem for some families. I’ve experienced this myself. However, Ken argued that negative responses aren’t reasonable because eating a plant based diet is more healthy than one with meat in it. It’s not that simple though, because many people believe that it’s healthier and more nutritious to incorporate meat into your diet.

Having watching videos and reading texts on the benefits of vegan diets, I have become a vegan diet advocate. An individual can do little, and it is really hard to avoid all the CO2 emission given the fact that even vegan foods need transportation from the farms. However, we are improving. What we are trying to do is not reducing greenhouse gas emission to an absolute zero — it is impossible from all kinds of aspects; all we are trying to do is to reduce it to a reasonable level. Therefore, being “vanguards” does not mean being extreme environmentalists; I do not think vanguards have such a narrow meaning. I believe that we all can be vanguards that influence the surrounding people to adopt reasonable practices such as plant-rich diet and reducing plane and automobile use. I recently finished a film project called “Grandpa’s Dumpling” that tries to show what happens when a young vegan teen meets his Grandpa in the traditional Chinese holiday when family reunites and eats dumplings. All I’m trying to say is that we all can use our talents and knowledge to influence our surrounding people, and I think that’s what being vanguards means.

I really appreciate your effort in advocating for a healthy vegan diet and for a better future. I am so curious about how did you change your diet and shift from consuming meat products on a daily basis to eating a plant-based diet. I also could make a sound of your definition of "vanguards" not as environmental extremists but as a role that everyone could fear not to become. We all for sure could make changes whether by consuming less meat or taking public transportation. It is really not a suffer for people to make changes, it just takes a little "boldness" to overcome and walk out of our comfort zone. Thank you again for being a "Vanguard"!

Ken likes to make every solution he says in his videos sound so simple. As if this is something we can easily just do, whenever we choose, and that then everything will fall into place and the world will be right again. Sure, he points out that it will take some effort and willpower, but after saying it once he makes it seem as though most of us really are just choosing to live the wrong way out of lack of knowledge or lack of compassion. I feel like saying this is a little naive in thinking that we've already come a lot farther than we actually have. Due to the lack of effort we've already seen within the country, many of us just do not have the option that Ken wants us to pick. 
<br><br>
Think about buying organically, or spending more on some well made clothes. Neither of these options are cheap. Organic, locally sourced plants are going to be a whole lot more expensive than grabbing a burger from the fast food joint down the street, and it takes more time, too. Time that many of us don't have to give. Buying well made clothes rarely throughout the year rather than cheap clothes many times also sounds like a better option, but again, doesn't work nearly as easily. Yes, some people may be able to just spend a few hundred dollars on good clothing purchases twice a year, but I can guarantee those two purchases of a few hundred dollars are still going to be a lot more than someone else's ten, even twenty, purchases that cost just a few dollars each. This is even the easier stuff! Looking at things more difficult, like taking public transportation, or switching to solar panels on your house, or larger changes like that are simply not possible for a vast amount of people.
<br><br>
Yes, individual change is important, and people should try to do what they can, but it is not the answer when what individuals can do is no where near enough.

The way I see it, overall cultural change is needed in the U.S in order to make our lifestyles more eco-friendly. A vanguard will inspire trends but not real change. People get over one trend and move on to the next. Our society thrives on consumerism and has highly materialistic values, and without changing the way we view what is important no real change will occur. It is no way sustainable to keep buying the new version or something every year just because it looks cool. For example, they’re a very little improvements made with each new iPhone, yet everyone rushes to get the newest one once it's released. It’s also difficult for some people to make these changes due to their lack of knowledge on the topic, their situations, or their culture. I liked that it was mentioned in the video that this can be a factor but I think it should’ve been discussed more. 
<br><br>
I also think the climate label idea on food items presented in Denmark is a great idea on a way to educate people. It would allow one to see just how much of an impact the goods they’re buying have on the planet and hopefully encourage them to make decisions that are better for the environment. Most people don’t know this information and wouldn’t try to change their lifestyle since they aren’t aware of what its doing to the planet. Personally, I’ve just started learning just how much of an impact a lot of my actions have and I’m lucky enough to be at a top college. For example, not all the knowledge we are learning in this class is presented to those that don’t have the opportunity to pursue an education. Even if it’s on the internet, (like the course website), many people may not know where to look. I think there’s some responsibility on us to educate those we know on what we are doing to the planet and the small changes we can make to reduce our environmental footprint.

Two things that I found most interesting from this lecture were the examples regarding the inter generational individuals can have with food and how immigration to America affected traditional cuisines. Before this lecture, I have never really considered the drastic role that Americanization had on different cultures food in regards to beef. In today's society where beef production has such severe consequences, I think that reworking recipes to reflect more traditional and less environmentally destructive ingredients could not only be healthy and fun, but a good way to reconnect with one's original cultural roots as well. Next, the idea of a "climate label," mentioned in the lecture intrigued me. Although I think it would definitely make people think more critically about their items and maybe even feel a little guilty about certain purchases; I'm not sure that their implementation would cause radical change to the way people shop. For instance, food already has nutritional facts posted on their packaging, yet people still choose to buy unhealthy products and often don't ever even read the labels. I could honestly see a similar thing happening with these "climate labels." Instead, I believe that raising the price of unsustainable items or placing a tax on them would be a more effective way of pushing consumers away from unsustainable product consumption.

First, I think you made a great point with respect to climate labels. While they would be extremely helpful in educating a broader base about the impact of their choices, I agree that behavioral changes when it comes to consumption would be limited. With that being said, by combining implementation of climate labels with a carbon tax, I think that the impact would be far more significant. By doing so, consumers would be forced to respond to some extent because of price changes but would also be able to see exactly why the prices increased. Again, it’s an imperfect system, but may be the quickest one to incite sweeping changes in American habits. Additionally, I think that those changes would signal to agricultural industry leaders that change is coming, and hope that they would respond accordingly with changes of their own further back in the supply chain.

This video was really informative in the sense that it really highlighted how important it is to be the change we want to see in the world. Despite being a Harvard educated scholar, who, let’s be quite honest, is probably wealthy, Ken has made a pact to himself to not use airplanes, despite not being able to attend academic conferences internationally. That, I believe, is the epitome of personal sacrifice for the greater good. To put the condition of the planet over oneself is something everyone should strive for.

<br><br>

I also do believe food waste is a huge problem in our society. I for one, am guilty of this. It makes me guilty to think of all the food I’ve wasted over the years. People used to say there are starving children all over the world (particularly Africa, which is wildly inappropriate but that’s a conversation for another day), but what they should really have been focused on is the environmental implications of it. Especially last year in the dining commons, I’m sure I wasted much more food than I actually consumed.

<br><br>

Moving forward, I intend on making noticeable life changes that benefit the environment. I tried to do this previously, but I wasn’t willing to sacrifice my quality of life for the greater good. I think we need to be the change we want to see, but on top of that, we need to strive to make this information that we’re learning here accessible to everyone so that we may make a difference on a global scale. While this solution starts with us, it must end with everyone because we can only solve this enormous problem with the participation of the world.

I completely agree. I often waste food trying especially living in a college apartment. I shop for groceries at Costco which sells in bulk, so I end up failing to use all the products that I bought. As a society, we are over-consumers and this leads us to waste more than we actually use. This is a definitely a problem since there are so many people in developing countries or even poverty-stricken individuals in our own countries that suffer from starvation. When it comes to our cultural diet we eat way too much meat. With so many holidays that promote the consumption of beef, chicken, etc. like thanksgiving, fourth of July, the super bowl, we are unnecessarily eating meat. Having it as a part of a balanced diet is one thing, but the way we consume it has to change. This change must begin with as you said, but I do believe change won't come until the problem begins to affect everyone.

I may answer "yes" to Ken's question. I think we do need a climate vanguard to guide people do the proper things to eliminate the climate footprint we created. Normally, it will be much harder for people do some actions by themselves because they firstly don't know what to start and don't know how to do in an efficient way. A professional vanguard may help a lot to guide them to do the right action. In order to make impacts among people, I believe the method should be either regulatory or beneficial. People would change their habits as if they find something which is beneficial for them financially. For example, if consuming meat will cost much more than plant-based foods, people may gradually switch their daily food to vegetables because it is cheaper. Also, if the public transportations, for instance, will save people both time and money, people would see the benefits very quickly and choose to take the public transportations instead of private driving. Taking proper actions on food and transportation would help a lot on eliminating the climate footprint and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Except for these recommendations, regulations may be applied. For example in China, starting from June last year, everyone had to classify garbages into four classes: recycle, non-recycle,  kitchen wasted, and harmful. The regulation was forced to every citizen to follow. However, some government policies are hard to perform in the US. As a result, the climate actions would base on everyone's volunteer. At this time, a climate vanguard is needed to lead them to do the proper things to eliminate the climate footprint in detail. I believe it also need a lot of effort and hard to achieve.

Online conferences seem like the best viable alternative to flying, I think it is ideally the best replacement. It seems easier for me, one could be able to hold conferences anywhere at anytime. Nowadays, we live in a modern civilization, in which, sadly, we have become dependent on technology. For instance, we heavily rely on our smartphones, thus it will be easier for us to switch to online conferences. While at the same time decreasing CO2 emissions from air travel, which we have learned contribute to about 2.5% as a whole but come from 1% of the earth’s population.

It still shocks me just how impactful our diet choices and food waste are. I think that climate labels are a great idea and could be extremely useful and eye opening to many. I think it would lead people to actually want to avoid the products and actually start changing their ways. I think that we should start acting now. It is important to see how things could be changed and get used to the change.

I remember growing up I always had a dinner that consisted of three things: carbs, vegetables, and protein. The protein was usually some form of animal meat and I remember my mom always had us drink a glass of milk for extra protein and calcium. I know my mom had and still has good intentions and she was providing my family with a diet that she thought was the most healthy. I think that she had this idea of a "healthy diet" installed in her from what she was used to growing up. I also remember in elementary school they taught us the food pyramid and what serving size was required in each section daily. There was meat and beans section, among other areas, which I now find interesting that they didn't just call it proteins. This food pyramid and my mothers ideas of a "healthy diet" I think are perfect examples of how our government and society have major influence on our daily lives. Luckily, my mom is also very accepting and supportive so when I told her that I wanted to try a pescatarian diet, she had no objections and tried new recipes that I could eat. Also since shifting my diet, my family has also made modifications to theirs and overall we as a family eat less meat, especially red meat. Although I know my one family isn't going to make a major difference, I think making these small changes can add up or at least start a bigger conversation, one that could take place outside our home. 
<br><br>

One point Ken made in the video that I thought was very fascinating was the part about climate labels, similar to nutrition labels. I think that this idea could have profound impacts on what food people consume and that it would help to inform people of the overall climate crisis. This idea reminded me of the part in the Patriot Act when Hasan Minhaj put how many clothing trucks on fire amounted to the single item of clothing. The people's reaction when they had this visual made them rethink the clothing item and I think this could have a similar affect with food.

I had a similar diet growing up, always having the classic American meat, potatoes, and vegetables for dinner with a glass of milk. As I got older and my mom started to get more into both health and climate science, I saw our family dinners become more diverse and less meat centered. As a vegetarian I am still constantly asked “how do you get your protein???”, and the answer is literally: everywhere. I feel like the protein myth and the food pyramid that you mentioned are roadblocks to a national increase in plant based diets, and hopefully more people will begin to realize how unnecessary meat (especially beef) is to our health and lives in general. Like you said, I think climate labels could definitely make people think more about the food they’re buying, especially considering how Ken mentioned that even just being vegan is not the ideal diet for the planet. There is an overwhelming amount of choice when shopping or going to restaurants, and I am still learning that things like almond milk, a vegan staple, are not actually as sustainable as I thought. Climate labels would make these choices much easier for those of us who think about sustainable eating habits and make unsustainable choices harder to ignore for those of us who don’t.


<br><hr>
I also had a similar diet growing up especially coming from a Mexican family, we used a lot of dairy products and meat in our cooking. I was taught that this was the most nutritious way to eat. In the morning, my mom would make my brother and I a protein shake and our traditional eggs with beans. For dinner, it would also be a meal with some sort of meat. I have tried going into a more plant-based diet in high school, but I found it extremely difficult because my family loved eating meat and dairy. Since I was not able to buy my own groceries, my only option was to eat the food we had at the house. Even though that is not a valid excuse for not trying to eat more plant-based, I still had a hard time transitioning and changing my eating habits. I am glad that your family supported you and followed your decision of going pescatarian. I believe that even small changes like these make a big difference. I also remember being taught the food pyramids in school and being served some sort of meat in our school lunches. When I came here to UCSB, I was glad to find that they had vegan and vegetarian options. Hopefully, more people find ways to transition to a more plant-based diet.

Personally, I found this video to be a little bit repetitive from what we have already learned, I feel like the idea of a plant-based diet has popped up multiple times throughout the course. Although I do agree that we should eat less meat and reduce the amount of food we waste. Since I work at one of the dining halls I see all the food that goes to waste, I mean trash bins of food daily. I know it is going to compost or something like that, but still just seeing freshly made food that is left over after each meal time, is almost a bit heartbreaking. I remember the first time I was told to toss all the left over food, I was so confused "Did I hear that right?" "Are you sure?" . But now unfortunately I am so used to it. All the food we don't eat gets tossed, and I always think doesn't that mean we should consume more? I mean at least for the school dining halls. We have all this food already, wouldn't not eating it mean we just throw it away. I always thought also why don't we just make less food, then I thought that maybe if that were the case we would get a lot of unhappy people complaining. So, what is the solution?

I agree that what we are hearing seems to be repetitive. A dietary shift away from our meat heavy diets to a more plant based diet and optimizing/reducing food waste have been mentioned numerous times. I assume this is because these are the most effective ways that the average person can reduce their impact on the climate crisis. With a plant based diet however you have to be conscious of the impact of your choices because importing fruits and vegetables or consuming out of season vegetables can be counter productive since the emissions it causes renders your diet pointless if the idea was to have less of an footprint. Labels on food that show whether they are good for the environment are a good idea because it would allow people to be better educated to make choices in their consumption. I think that this would also result in more people who have limited knowledge to the climate crisis or the impact of their diets choosing environmentally friendly options since they would have the resources to do so.

We absouletely need a climate “vanguard”. I have no idea what the debate is on the use of the word so I’m putting that in quotes just in case. However as Ken was discussing in the video, the vanguard is may up out of us as individuals, making lifestyle changes and encouraging as many others as we can as quickly as possible. The wasteful way in which Americans live their lives is not even questioned by most people. The amount of food I saw wasted every day in my highschool cafeteria is shameful. The overconsumption of meat and dairy is needless. Our materialistic and consumerist lifestyles are decreasing people’s happiness and leading them to live more slefish and pressured lives. We absouletely need people to take an active and fighting stance against a culture that resists the structural changes we need. I particularly connect this in my own head with the green new deal. As Ken has mentioned this emncompasses much of what we’ve discuessed in class as potential solutions. This beginning plan of action would hopefully shove even the unwilling into living greener lives, and hopefully realizing just how easy it can be; and how much we stand to gain as a society.

The most fascinating part of this lecture video was when Ken mentioned the idea of "climate labels", this got me thinking. I believe if a label were put on a food that showed it's economic impact, just like a nutritional label, then we would see consumers being guilted into purchasing environmentally friendly foods. It would also create a societal awareness that you will need to start thinking about the impact of your food, in addition to, the awareness of your peers when shopping. This climate label could be applied to clothing, food, or any other inanimate object -- it would be fantastic to see our government implement this tactic. Not only could we be aware of the actual consequences of our purchasing habits but also those of our peers. This is a bit far into the future, but this concept would also force companies to reduce their carbon footprint or ecological impact to satisfy consumers/ the market if they are planning on staying afloat.
<br><br>

Besides switching our diets to something that is more plant-based, I can't see a better way of informing the consumer about the consequences of their purchasing habits. It would enforce new regulations on companies without actually applying a ton of policy!

I completely agree with you about your interest in " climate labels" and about the reality of climate changes. "We are just normal people", that's always the most factual but real sentence for us to say. After taking this class, we personally have better awareness and method of protecting the climate.  However, could the world hear us? How much could we change is always the first thing we should consider. Anyway,  I will look at the " climate label" of a product before I buy it next time!


<br><hr>
When people think about change, they often associate the word as something negative because they’ll think “what’s wrong with what I’m doing now? I have always been doing this and nothing bad has happened”. They never realize what they are doing to the planet because currently, there hasn’t been an event that directly impacted their lifestyle. I feel like if those people took this class, their mindset will definitely change because they’ll understand their actions actually affect every individual living on this planet, even if they live thousands of miles away from you. In addition, I like the idea of “climate labels” because it’ll guilt-trip people by showing how their lifestyle is causing climate change and how their negative actions can be avoided by choosing something less harmful to the planet. For example, if someone were to purchase beef, the label could should how much CO2 was emitted for that amount of beef in comparison to vegetables.

While I do think we need to be the change we want to see, I think that in order for it to actually alleviate the climate crisis, it needs to be a group effort. Ken asked if we need to work now or if we should wait until everyone is on board for a sweeping climate crisis, and while there is a necessity to start now, it won't have the effect we want unless we are able to influence others to also be aware of the climate crisis and how our actions can fix or further push it. Before taking this class, I was already aware that humans, especially Americans carried a large environmental footprint. And unfortunately, most of the reasons are ingrained in our culture, traditions, and just day-to-day life. For example, driving is very common in the United States, hosting barbecue get-togethers are common, visiting other countries and exploring the world is always a goal. But these all contribute immensely to greenhouse gases. While I do think that we need to change our ways and "simplify, simplify" as stated in the past lectures, I think we need to also create changes in our government laws and policies. I think we need to introduce ways in our society that will force people to take more environmentally-safe options. And yes, "force" because I think driving is too convenient, and not everyone will willingly give up meat or flying. People have places they need to be but I think that if we are able to create alternative ways to get to a place or to cutting down meat consumption, people will do what they need to to help the climate crisis. For a long time, we were already somewhat aware that we were hurting the planet but did nothing about it. Because of this, it is important that we start now. We do not have time to wait for people to "be on board" because the planet will continue to go on with or without us. If humans want to continue, we need to make a compromise with the earth, and one that is permanent. Humans need to make permanent lifestyle changes, and our society needs to prioritize this compromise in their food distribution, social infrastructure, and overall culture.

After completing Ken’s lecture,” Do we need a climate vanguard?”, it was clear to me how little knowledge I had about this issue that is negatively affecting our planet. Although, I cannot say I can completely change my lifestyle of how to be the most environmentally friendly as possible immediately I have seen certain growths in this process. For example over the past two years, about the time I was informed in detail of the climate crisis, I have been very cautious of various everyday acts to help reduce my carbon footprint. Things such as a diet that is primarily plant based with very little red meat to things like not taking a single flight throughout this time. It is important to me as an individual to properly take care of my body and my planet as I do everything I can to, but it is not just enough for me to do these things. I cannot express how vital it is to make sure the right people get into office to make significant changes to the environment in a positive way. This is why Ken stresses time and time again the importance of voting and how it is one of the true ways to ensure change. I believe things such as a carbon tax and labels for food that properly express the negative effects on the environment will help make a difference. It will hold the common individual to a much higher standard and act as a source of accountability. Although this can seem a bit extreme it is the appropriate means to achieve the desired ends, which is a healthy planet. I find it discouraging how hard a fight we have to put up just to save our planet, but it is the reality of the world that must be dealt with. Overall I appreciate Ken’s optimism of him knowing change will happen and he makes an excellent point by saying that it is better to get ahead earlier. Not only will the quality of the planet increase, but also the quality of life.

I agree that it will be difficult to switch my lifestyle to one that reduces my carbon footprint as much as possible, but each week there is always something new to learn that makes taking new steps easier and easier. Something as simple as switching our diets is so easy and doable for a lot of people, and I am doing my best to transition to eating more plant-based foods, and I have already stopped eating beef. But sometimes those steps seem like nothing compared to if we actually elected politicians that genuinely understood how drastically we need to alter our lifestyles and were committed to making those changes to protect the environment and making the transitions in our lives easier.
<br><br>

I do think that a carbon tax would be a significant step in reducing our fossil fuel consumption, and I do hope it happens soon. Unfortunately our country needs to be forced to change our mindset about fossil fuels, and while I’m sure lots of people are going to complain at first, it needs to happen. People will get used to it and it will become the new norm. It does get tiresome that we must resort to things like this for people to really get it; we are constantly fighting an uphill battle that’s end seems to be the destruction of our planet right now with how unpredictable our environment and consumption habits are. It should be obvious to people at this point that if we do not change, we will all suffer the consequences of what we have done to the planet, and it will take even more work, and cost even more money to fix it at that point than if we did something right now.
<br><br>

I think we will get there eventually, and I hope it is without some massive disaster, and we will be all better off and happier for it.

My mom always told me “if there’s something you want to do, don’t wait around for someone to do it with you”. While I agree that we need sweeping climate action, we should not at all wait for the rest of the world to “come around”, because who knows when that will happen? There’s a good chance that when it does it might be too late. If we want to put a stop to the climate crisis, we have to do it now rather than waiting for anyone else to do it with us.
<br><br>
However, it is still incredibly important that we do our best to educate others about climate change and encourage them to take action as well. A climate vanguard would undeniably be helpful in paving the way to climate action(whether it be by making eco-friendly lifestyles more popular, experimenting with ways to be eco-friendly, educating people about climate change, etc.), and it would only be doing good in the process by reducing emissions, even if just by a slight amount. If every person in our lecture did something, anything, to reduce their carbon footprint, and then encouraged 3 other people to do the same, and so on, we could quite possibly create significant change. And I don’t just mean in reducing emissions, I mean in starting to change people’s mentality about the climate crisis and the role they can play in curbing it. 
<br><br>
 I loved the idea of Denmark’s climate labels, because it is simple yet effective. It does not force anyone to take action but it does bring awareness to the decisions they are making. I truly do believe that if people were reminded each time they bought groceries that their purchase had an effect on climate, they would try to be more mindful rather than mindlessly picking up whatever snack looks good in the moment. Although it will probably take a while for changes such as climate labels to actually be implemented, we can absolutely begin to create change now, and we shouldn’t stand around waiting for the rest of the world to do it with us.

I completely agree with everything you stated here in your comment. It’s hard for me to fathom that this is even a question of if we should start a climate vanguard or wait around for everyone else to do it. Isn’t that what everyone is doing already? Nobody wants to actually be the change we need in the world, everyone is just sitting around waiting for everyone else to do it so that you don’t have to make these sacrifices before everyone else. That’s just a complete pessimistic mentality and it needs to end now if we actually want change to happen to save our dying earth. If we are just sitting here wondering what we can do to stop climate change and Ken finally gives us the answer to that, which is an important lifestyle change, why wouldn’t you take this advice? Why wait? Why not just be a part of the movement to end the climate crisis and then that will encourage the others who are waiting for you to change the way that you consume? I think if you really are concerned about the climate crisis you can at least make one simple lifestyle change to reduce your carbon footprint, or even just spread the word about how important this issue actually is. Your mom is completely right, “if there’s something you want done, don’t wait around for someone to do it for you”.


<br><hr>
thank you for sharing and I totally agree with your comment! Your comment reminds me of another popular phrase, which is "Be the change you want to see in this world". Although this phrase is almost turning into a cliche, it is nonetheless true and applies to this situation of the climate crisis very well. If we want to help to save our environment and all of the other lives that are dependent upon this planet, then we should not and could not wait around for others to make some sweeping changes because it is very likely that everyone else is thinking of the same thing and waiting for someone else to take the lead, thus resulting in inaction because nobody is willing to make that first step. We should be the ones leading and making those first steps to protect our environment because we are doing it not only for the sake of ourselves but also for every other species on the planet and our future generations. There is simply no time for us to waste on debating who should start taking actions to address the climate crisis. I also agree with your comment about Denmark's food-labeling strategy because it is an effective way to raise public awareness as it helps to get people to recognize the impacts of their actions and decisions on the climate, which in turn motivates the public to be more careful and conscious of the choices they make in their daily lives in regards to food, clothing, and many more. Educating the public on the harmful consequences of their actions and decisions on the environment is the very first step in prompting the society and the general public to pay close attention to climate crisis and to see its pressing nature and urgency, which then would push or even force them to carefully consider and implement potential remediations to the damages done to our planet.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment, the time to act is now. If no one steps up to help the climate, it will deteriorate. We cannot wait until people decide that change is necessary. We know this now, therefore we need to lead now. I also agree that the Denmark climate labels are a strategic idea. People are lazy and will not take the time out of their day to search if every item on their grocery list is in an environmentally friendly season. However, if people were aware that their food at that time of year was harming the environment, they would be more inclined to choose another food. While it is important to be conscious of how our life decisions affect the environment and to spread awareness to others, we need to do more. We need to vote for politicians who will advocate for the environment. Reinforcements such as the climate labels, will not occur until politicians are voted in that can implement nationwide changes.

<br><hr>
I agree with you and your mother’s saying. My mother used to tell me things like “Be courageous and do something that you know is right because others will do the same if they know that it is also the right thing to do”. If we can spread tips and advice on how to reduce an individual's carbon footprint as fast as gossip travels, we may be able to create a movement within one another as a community. As citizens of a first world that is contributing the most greenhouse gas emissions globally, we, as those citizens, should act upon the issues because it is our responsibility and obligation. We are causing the suffering of third world countries such as Africa who produce a fifth less than us with four times as many people in population. Our current government and the boomer generation can not consider the climate crisis as a priority to reverse, but those who are educated with the knowledge (millennials or Gen Z’ers) of how we contribute to the climate change, can really help. No matter how small the deed, as long as everyone has an effort to try and experiment with minimal living or no meat, we can be a different kind of role model for others in different first world countries.

While it is important to make the switch to a plant-based diet and limiting air travel/commuting by car, it is relatively useless while the people in power are still making political decisions that are causing large scale damage to the environment. It is really frustrating to watch the news and hear all the republicans disrespect climate scientists and activists who are devoting themselves to protecting our planet, only to be laughed at and talked down on. For these reasons, I have felt discouraged from taking a stand on issues I believed in; however, I see now that the more people who speak up against the climate crisis, the more likely we are to see changes in the immediate future, such as climate labels and the more radical Carbon Tax. Answering Ken’s question, I definitely think climate vanguards are crucial in order to ease the transition between our heavily fossil-fuel dependent economy and a widespread sustainable lifestyle. While climate activists and policies like the Green New Deal might come off as radical today, it is unarguably necessary to make these changes and it is only a matter of time before even climate change deniers begin to believe the truth. Although this is a bit of a far-fetched analogy, the political resistance against the climate crisis almost reminds me of the issue of slavery in the U.S. during the Antebellum period. Along with abolitionists who publicly fought to abolish slavery, there were also many people who disagreed with it but didn’t want to make any changes because of the discomfort it would bring to American society. Eventually, this issue could not be avoided any longer, which led to the violent Civil War, and the consequent death of many. Not having any set policies or plans for the aftermath, reconstruction after the war was an incredibly difficult -- and arguably unsuccessful -- process. If there had been more of a gradual shift towards the emancipation of slaves, perhaps adapting to this huge sociopolitical change wouldn’t have been so difficult. I see a similar trend going on with the climate crisis, and I think if small changes aren’t made over time, there will be political disaster in the future.

I liked how Ken mentioned that someone’s culture plays a big role in the kind of food that one eats. Growing up in a Mexican household I learned meat is a very big part of Mexican cuisine. I once contemplated switching my diet but I realized that it would be very difficult due to what I have grown up eating and what I’m used to, so I have never made a change. While switching diets can be very helpful, so is reducing food waste. Growing up my parents always told my brothers and I that we should never waste food because there are people who don’t have any. I’m very glad that I was taught that and while unaware at a young age that I was playing a part in helping out the planet. I hate that we are being asked “Should we begin acting now or should we wait until everyone is on board for sweeping climate action?” It shouldn’t have to be a question. Everyone has to start making changes and address problems now and not wait. It will definitely be difficult, but it is possible.

It really is astonishing to see how much meat is integrated into the everyday diet of your average American. As someone who was born and raised here, in a fairly affluent community nonetheless, I was so accustomed to having a large portion of meat on my plate every single time. However, after doing some travels in recent years (which I now know to be terrible for carbon emissions), I realized the stark contrast in diet in comparison to all the other places I visited. While they did still have meat options, the amount of plant items were extremely abundant. This all ties back to how our climate crisis does definitely stem from a cultural issue. We don't have to eat meat and the majority of our backgrounds aren't necessarily forcing us to. However, we have this preconceived idea that avoiding meat is weird so we choose not to do it. This is why being a "vanguard" is so important in this aspect. Of course, such a concept isn't exclusively regarding climate change. For anyone to want to provoke change in something, they have to start and pioneer whatever alteration they want made. Otherwise, no one will follow their words.

Ken specifically addressed "food" in this lecture and encourages people to make a little change. And I believe that Ken believes a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle will be the most ideal lifestyle for environmental purposes. But also, I found something interesting with vegans or vegetarians during my years in the United States. It begins with a popular fruit in the United States, "Avocado".

<br><br>

Avocado originally comes from Mexico, and avocado is extremely popular in California due to the Hispanic population here. The Hispanic diet cannot live without guacamole, I think. And many Californians started to accept this food. Mexican restaurants are everywhere in California. Avocado is not a popular fruit in my home country, most people do not eat it. I barely know about this fruit before I came. It is true that avocado is highly nutritious, thus avocados become popular and ideal options for many vegans or vegetarians in their daily meals. Maybe some of the vegans or vegetarians change their diet for environmental purposes; nevertheless, the growth of avocado requires a long time and a lot of water. Mexico as the origin and largest avocado export country has a highly developed avocado-cultivating industry. Thus it leads to conflicts with lands, water, and other plants. People remove other plants to plant just avocado, and the land is limited and growing avocado requires good quality soil that people fight about the lands. Not to mention a large amount of water needed. Are those avocado-consuming vegans or vegetarians really helpful to the environment?

I do agree that people need to reduce food waste, and I think this is the primary problem when talks about food and environment. To change diet, I do not think it is essential right now, people need various kinds of nutrition.  Working on a solution to reduce food waste, is what the government should do in order to protect the environment.

The idea that we would be able to change our carbon footprint is imaginatively amazing, however it is realistically almost impossible for most people as they struggle with changing their lifestyles and we could not effectively reduce our carbon footprint drastically as a whole. While online conferences seem like the best viable alternative to flying, I personally believe that it won't be as effective for most business related matters and won't be pursued as a option for most big businesses. Yes, conferences are more accessible with the growing technology industry, but it doesn't provide the same atmosphere for these meetings that they need. People need to understand that their waste adds up per person and we need to hold ourselves accountable to what we leave behind.

After watching the lecture video, there is one concept that leaves in my mind, which is the idea of “Americanizing."  It tells that many different cultural cuisines in America is introducing a large amount of meat to the cultural diet. I am pushing myself to consume less meat in my daily meal, and this is not hard for me to do so, while I am also urging my parents and friends to do so, too. Being a vegan is good to reduce climate change, but sometimes I am also wondering about it. For example, for the fruit and vegetables travels from millions of miles away by the airplanes in order to keep it fresh. Wouldn’t these food generate more carbon dioxide to Earth? And this not only happens at one times, it happens everyday, due to large amount of consumption by human, at least in Hong Kong as I known. Perhaps we need to advocate to eat the fruits and vegetables that grow up locally, and these can only reduce carbon emission of being a vegan, or else vegetarian would do more harm to Earth than those who eat meat.

I found this comment particularly interesting since it talks about how our daily diet could contribute carbon footprint not only thought their production, but their transportation would also cost a significant amount. Becoming a vegan is an effective way to reduce our carbon footprint, but, more importantly, we should eat locally. We need to avoid consuming foods that are transported from far way. One solution that was previously mentioned in lectures is to encourage small farms rather than large farms. There are two reasons to promote small farms. The first reason is that large farms highly rely on machines to harvest, which lowered the efficiency of that land since they have to plant crops with larger gaps between them such that machines can harvest. What’s worse, machines cut off the possibility of intercropping and led to a reliance on fertilizers and pesticides which can cause many other problems. Second, promoting small farms would reduce our reliance on transporting foods all over the world. This would enable us to eat locally and thus more environmentally friendly. However, this solution cannot be achieved by individuals but rather by policy makers, which stresses the importance on voting as we have discussed.

A few things stood out to me in this lecture, the first was how food is a part of a culture and how people within a culture that do not adhere to them can be seen as disrespecting their culture. While I think this can be true I also think that it is more directly related to how your parents eat. This is because they feed you as you grow up and you normally accept their eating habits as your own. For example, my parents raised me and my sister on eating meat daily. One year when I was about 11 I had seen a full pig roasting and really thought about becoming a vegetarian. My mom tried to be supportive as I thought about it, but my dad told me I would be on my own to make my own food, which I didn't really care about. When it came to reality as my family continued to make the same food filled with meat I gave up on that idea until recently. This is how most homes are, the kids eat what the parents feed them and then the kids grow up and are just used to consuming that much meat. 
<br><br>
 The second thing that stood out to me was the idea of Climate labels. I love this idea because I often choose what to buy based on the nutritional labels, so I would already be looking at the labels. I think this is a great way for people to really know what is good for the environment because, in all honesty, most people will not spend the time to research and remember the products that are better for the environment. It would make it really easy for consumers to pick the planet healthy choice if this was done.

I agree; when you're a kid and you live at home with your parents, it's difficult to control your own diet and the amount of meat you consume. I know that that has been the experience for me since pork, beef, and chicken are a big part of Korean cuisine. Since my mom usually cooked all my meals, the first time I've been able to truly choose the types of food that I eat was when I went to college. Eating at the dining hall especially helps because there is always a salad bar and some type of vegetarian alternative that I can rely on, but I catch myself craving Korean barbeque and other dishes and it's hard to satiate that without actually eating it. I know that it is selfish and destructive to the environment, but I am trying my best to at least cut out red meat in my diet.


<br><hr>
I also agree that climate labels are a great idea. It gives people a little more control and responsibility over their carbon footprint, and information about the environmental consequences of certain foods will become easily accessible to the public. People are inherently lazy, and having a label that can be quickly and easily read may change our grocery shopping habits just as the number of calories a serving of food has may attract or deter a consumer.

One of the most interesting things that was said in this video was about Denmark's plan to put climate labels on food, indicating its specific carbon footprint. Even though Ken merely just mentioned it, I found myself very intrigued and supportive of it. In previous ES classes, I have learned that one of the worst things you can do food-wise is to eat food is out of season. This is explained by Ken in his example of asparagus. However, like most people, I don't really know what's in season and what's out of season. I don't know whether certain food is meant to be grown in my region or if it native somewhere else. I don't know what companies are more local to me and therefore having a lesser impact. I don't know a lot of things about my food. So yes, I could learn about these things or I could even just look it up; but the matter of the fact is that this just simply isn't reasonable. I'm not going to be in a store and begin researching what my least impactful purchase would be. And if I wouldn't do that, then the people who don't give a damn about our climate crisis won't either.
<br><br>

Denmark's plan to put climate labels on food just makes sense. It would allow people to learn more about their food and allow them to make easy decisions on what they buy. While it most likely wouldn't make a sweeping change, it just seems silly that it wouldn't be there. Hopefully something similar to this will eventually make its way into the US.

The part when Ken mentioned about the online conferences make me think of the recent issue of coronavirus happening in China. This epidemic virus has been changing a lot of things and conventions, and one particular thing is working pattern. People cannot compute to work as they are required by the government to stay at home due to the spread of virus. Therefore, online conferencing is becoming a big thing, like Ken said in the lecture, and there are news suggesting that because of this event, the stock value of companies like Skype has been rising. I believe that online working will become a major trend in the future, which is a great sign that people might be spending less time and money on traveling around the world and taking whatever transportation, any of which could be emitting a huge amount of carbon dioxide. 

<br><br>

To answer the question at the end of the video: should we become the climate vanguard now? It is a very simple question to me because there are countless subjects teaching us about the rising graph of event statistics, whether it’s economics, or it’s geography. When things grow, there will always be the first one. There was one person who started to plant crops, and then there was agriculture. There was one pioneer species, and then millions of it. If there is no first climate vanguard, there will never be a time when “everyone is onboard”, and the climate crisis will never be on the list to solve. Therefore, actions need to be taken.

I totally agree with you. The two choices in the question at the end of the video are not conflicting. The only way to make everybody on board is to act now. Just like what you said, there will always be a "first one", and if we wait, then everybody's gonna wait and then people would never be "on board". So I think we need to start acting now definitely. We need to be the vanguards. Also, I like your example of the online conference. It's quite popular these days, and we've seen them in the movies too(like the ones in the Iron Man). I think this is a good way to save the unnecessary energy waste in travelling, and this could generate more jobs and opportunities.


<br><hr>
Over the last two weeks, it has been extremely interesting how coronavirus has taken the world by storm. From just some cases in china to now extreme measures to quarantine people in Italy and cancellation of almost everything, it is amazing to see the domino effect of how people react when they are in danger. 

<br><br>

So, according to this class...aren't we in danger from the climate crisis? And why aren't we reacting the way we should?
<br><br>


I believe the reason is people in this world just do not care if something isn't affecting them. YES we need a climate vanguard, but until people realize the truth of what could happen, which is far worse than the virus going around now, nothing dramatic will happen. It is scary, but true.

I definitely agree with Ken that we need to start acting on these implications of climate change now rather than later. If no one makes that first step, no one will follow. Reaching a consensus so that a large amount of people will act altogether at once is more unreliable for the future of the earth. Change has to begin somewhere and climate vanguards are making that first step so that they can influence others to make that step as well–their friends, family, acquaintances... As climate vanguards begin to make changes in their lifestyle they can find different alternatives to the way they have been living. In my perspective, it is easier for me to take action on something when I already know what I can do because it has worked out so great with others, whatever the case it may be: trying new diets, skincares, organization skills, etc… The same can be applied to the way we consume food, resources, or products in order to make more adequate and bigger steps in to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet. Denmark’s idea of labeling food for how it impacts the PLANET sounds amazing to me. Individual’s can then begin to see if their asparagus is good to eat during a certain season or not. Of course, these solutions will not work on everyone, but as Ken mentioned, vanguards can develop more alternatives in time to influence others more and more to make changes in their lifestyle.

I agree as well, if no one makes the first move we will be stuck in the same cycle forever. I think that the United States will be one of the last to catchup, though. Like you said Denmark may start labeling their food and as Ken said the U.S. added meat to most foreign recipes. I think if we just become more conscious eaters this problem may be solved, but not everyone will be on board. I like how you mention doing something you know has worked and I think that is 100 percent true! If we see that everything works in other countries it will be easier to hop on board. Hopefully this begins sooner than we imagine and same with the affects on the planet

After watching the lecture, I felt quite motivated to contribute to environmental protection because according to what professor Ken has said, it sounds like you don’t have to be a scholar or a politician to be the leader of environmental protection. You can be an IT worker or simply a voter to make a major contribution to environmental protection. Specifically, you can be an engineer and built an online platform for people to have an online conference. You could be a voter to vote for the price of the carbon. It just suddenly feels like you don’t have to give up what you want to do to protect the environment. You can choose the career you like and make contributions from what you enjoy doing. 
<br><br>

Specifically, about the online course, I had an online course at UCSB. the experience is awesome. Sometimes it is more convenient than the offline course. We ask professor questions with emails. If we really have something to talk about with the professor, we can connect with him via Zoom. As mentioned before, flying is the worst thing you could do to the climate. I am an international student. The aggregated time length that I spent on the airplane is at least 48 hours. It is bad for the environment, and also exhausted for me too. If we can study at home with online courses, everything will be simpler. Thus, I think universities worldwide could also take action to start to reduce carbon emissions by putting online courses or other education modes.

I also felt motivated to do my part in lessening the effects that we humans have on the environment. There is only one Earth, yet we continue to pollute and destroy the planet with no concern for what is to come. I agree that you do not have to be someone with power to evoke change in how our society functions. Like some of our fellow classmates mentioned before in lecture, we have the ability to bring out change through voting. I know that not everyone can vote, but for those who can, it is really important that we use our right to vote to have our voices be heard. Otherwise, we are doing a disservice by not speaking for the planet and all the life that lives on it because it cannot speak for itself. By voting for elected officials that care about the environment, we can pass laws and regulations that will protect it and allow it to thrive, instead of harming it. 

<br><br>

I also agree that we should have more online classes made available to us as students. Not only is it more convenient for some, it can also help reduce carbon emissions. I see numerous students that commute to school by car from nearby cities such as Ventura or Oxnard, to even some that live right here in Isla Vista, but still drive to school. By offering more online courses, students who drive on a daily basis would not need to, thus decreasing their carbon footprint. As you mentioned before, more online classes or easier accessibility to alternative forms of online education would benefit international students. By cutting out the need to fly, carbon emissions can be cut dramatically. Not only would this help our planet, it would also be less financially expensive for international students if they did not have to fly multiple times a year just to attend school to get an education.

All I can think about while watching this video and Ken telling us to take action now and willingly stop flying is about my brother and his wife. They travel every single year sometimes twice a year. They fly simply because they find the tickets “cheap,” I believe if prices were to rise they would travel less. It would bother me how much they would travel before because of the money they would spend and the fact that they always go to the same place. Now I'm even more bothered by them because of the ampunt of emission they are contributing to Earth. I can not wait to go home and have a serious talk with them and let them know about the effects that their actions are having.

I am not any better as an american i enjoy the consumption of meat. However I have been trying (succeeding for now) to change my diet and cut down on the beef I consume. I have been subsituting beef and other meats with chicken and tuna. It has been hard as ken discussd the cuture in meat eating households. I am so used to eating yet I hope to keep up with my new diet.

I completely agree with your idea that if it was more expensive to fly, people would likely do it less. I fully support a carbon tax that would make this happen, even if it meant that my dreams to travel the world would be harder to reach. It is easy to put the planet on the back burner in your mind if you have the opportunity to travel to Europe very cheaply right in front of you. You don’t see the destruction of the planet from all the greenhouse emissions while envisioning yourself eating fresh croissants in the streets of Paris. If there was a similar tax on meat, say eating a burger at the dining hall would charge $2 extra rather than a veggie-based choice fully covered by meal swipes, I would be far less likely to choose the meat option, and many of my peers would do the same. In addition to the benefits to the environment, a tax on these things would also cultivate more value in what we take for granted. If the plane tickets to Europe weren’t so cheap and easily attainable, people would put more value into their vacations, as it would take much longer to save the money to go and they would feel it was a great accomplishment to put in so much effort over such a period of time. In regards to diet, only eating meat on special occasions would increase its value and would signify the importance of the event it was consumed at. Although implementing a carbon tax to decrease the amount of flying is not something an individual can do themselves, this does not mean they can’t do anything to help decrease emissions. I found it inspiring when Ken explained how we can each take a look into our own lives and change our diets now. There is no need to rely on others to band together and vote or sign petitions for this one; we can begin the change at our next meal.


<br><hr>
Honestly, I think that the ideas in this video promote so much change for the climate crisis. I think that a carbon tax is a great idea and I think that putting the climate labels on everything would be so beneficial, especially people who are consciously making the decision to become vegan/vegetarian for the climate. I also think that something so "in your face" would make a huge difference. When your flying, you never see the effects and honestly when I'm on vacation, the last thing that I'm thinking about is if I'm hurting the environment or not. We make traveling way too easy for people. Buy your tickets a little in advance, the cheaper that it is, and not to mention the fact that companies will advertise and compete with each other to put out the lowest price. I don't blame anyone who wants to fly, it's an amazing tool that we have, but I think that we would be able to have people fly a lot less with a carbon tax.
<br><br>
I have decided to stop eating beef altogether and I have also been substituting it for chicken. I feel for the people who grew up and have some cultural relationship to meat and I feel that they have a harder time cutting that out, but imagine if we had an "in their face" way to show how bad it is for the environment; such as the climate labels. At the least people would think twice.

I like how professor refer to the early adapters as the architects of the future. I definitely agree with the statement that there should be a bold group of people who choose to act as early as possible (now) rather than waiting until everyone is on board for protecting our climate. If we choose to merely wait, there is no way that everyone can realize the importance of exercising practices regarding climate change. Having a group of vanguards will influence more and more people’s attitudes and behaviors over time, and they will always push the movement forward as they become more active and have more people joining them.

The concept of a sudden wave of radical change on the topic of climate change sounds fairly idealistic. I am not claiming that it is impossible… Who knows what the new generation has up their sleeves? I am not opposed to the idea of it either; I do think it is absolutely necessary in securing a better future for our species and the life around us. I will say that this is mostly a tug a war fight between the “boomer” generation and Generation Z. The opinions and the strategies in which they promote and advocate their causes are strikingly contrasting, and there is little let up on both parties in a compromise of issues. This is a fight that must be consistently fought with an unwavering calibre of intensity. It is hard to avoid, with the demonstrations of the youth on campuses and communities rallying for immediate change to the course of action taken by politicians on all levels, as well as the implementation of workshops on campuses discussing the environmental aspect to eating and solutions in being resourceful with what is in one’s cards.

In the lecture, Ken talked about some solutions which can help reduce greenhouse gas emission.
<br><br>
I strongly agree with the “carbon tax” solution mentioned by Ken and i think it will effectively work. As Ken mentioned, it’s depressing that probably most of the people will likely not make a necessarily personal changes to adequately come back to climate crisis until required to do so. In this case, adding carbon tax directly on fossil fuel supplier, and the tax will increase over time would be very beneficial. Ken gave an example of flight. By adding carbon tax on fossil fuel, the price of flight will increase over time which will result people to stop flight as the price is being higher and higher. The carbon tax can effectively prevent some companies from harming the environment for gaining much profit since most people who disagree with climate change are actually benefit from fossil fuel production. This can also help people make decision to reduce their CO2 emission as the higher and higher price.
<br><br>
Adding “environmental label” on the food nutrition label on the food is also a good idea. I believe most of people will check the nutrition label first before deciding to purchase the food. Or at least they will check the expiration date which will make them notice the nutrition label. As for me, i will always check the nutrition label first since i want to keep a healthy diet and also a good body shape. The “environmental label” can help us to make decision of wether buying the environmental-unfriendly food or not.
<br><br>
Switching to a plant-rich diet is also important and more beneficial to reduce greenhouse gas emission. Though it’s true that it’s hard for people to adopt the plant-rich diet immediately, somme solutions like slowly transitioning would be effective at helping people switching their eating habit.

I really like your idea that adding “environmental label” on the food nutrition label on the food. I personally don’t really know what seasons to eat, and I believe most people don’t. Therefore, I strongly believe that the use of these types of labels on our products affects whether people consume them. This will indeed help our planet and the emissions we generate. I think it is important to raise awareness of the environmental issues currently facing our planet. I also believe it is extremely important to ensure how easy and easy it is for people to help the planet now. I think most people think they need to make huge changes to help our planet, and they think it will require them to put in too much effort, which is why they don't actually do anything. I think if people knew it would be easy, they would really make a difference.

I learned what vegetarianism was from That’s So Raven. I saw the episode I’m thinking of most likely around 2005, at five years old, and in it, Raven questioned why her friend Chelsea chooses not to eat meat, and how she even does so. Chelsea explains that she went vegetarian because of her concern for the treatment of animals, and that it is in fact very possible to have a healthy and fulfilling diet that doesn’t include meat. Before seeing that episode, I had no idea that a diet without meat was possible. This small and silly anecdote illustrates why the climate vanguard is so important. The efforts of early adopters directly help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, of course, but equally as important, their presence educates about and normalizes the necessary changes that everyone must eventually make. Similarly to my That’s So Raven story, I learned about veganism from a youtuber I watched regularly at the time, who had adopted a vegan diet in an effort to help the planet. This made me realize how possible and even easy it was to make lifestyle changes that before were unthinkable to me. I believe it is the role of the climate vanguard to be an example for the rest of the world, and I would very much like to be a part of that movement.

I remember that episode as well! It is pretty funny how we are educated through silly shows made for kids on serious topics that we actually learn about later in life. I remember my friend sent me a pretty gruesome video on animal abuse on farms and it made me go vegan for a while, just because it was such a horrific sight. But as I grow older and am more educated on the topic, I realize that even besides the disgusting treatment of animals by these livestock owners, there are plenty of other reasons to go vegan/vegetarian, and it really is not that hard. Simple switches to diet and lowering consumption of meat and other dairy products is very realistic and I plan on putting it into action in my own life.

At very beginning of the lecture, Ken points out an inconvenience truth that people will likely not make the necessary personal changes to adequately combat climate crisis. Although many has knew the fact of climate crisis, but how many of them acts on it? People tend not to be vanguards because it means violating to current situation, which they are used to. When we look from another side, the delay of action provides us more time to prepare for transition in our lifestyle. However, it’s still a tough process since changing lifestyle is a challenge to culture. As Ken suggests we should switch our diet habit to largely plant-rich diets, it means we have to challenge the tradition thought that eating meat is a sign of wealth. At this point, I understand why Ken believes only sweeping cultural changes can lead to successful mitigation of the climate crisis.
<br><br>
Besides, I totally agree with Ken that we should elect politicians that will implement programs pricing carbon because it shows that these candidates are considering our planet. They are climate vanguards to publicly challenge profits of fossil fuel suppliers. In all, regarding with Ken’s question whether we in fact need a climate vanguard to begin working out what life in the future will be like, my answer is a definite yes.

The main idea for this week’s lecture video is to tell the audiences what we can directly do now to save our planet. Just like the previous lecture video about the flying. Professor Ken suggests people to stop flying right now to decrease their individual carbon footprint. This time is about the food. During the lecture, I feel shocked when I know sometimes veggies can burden on the climate. For example, Ken mentioned that eating asparagus during the winter period will produce more carbon than eating meat because people need to transport them from other places by shipping. As a result, we need to think more about how to create a rational and reasonable diet instead of always eating vegetables blindly. Additionally, I think it is necessary to directly tell more unprofessional people about the carbon they have made when they try to purchase food and have thoughts of wasting food. I think the markets can put posters beside the goods shelf to tell people about the carbon consume about the food on it. When people buy them, they will know about its impact on the climate. Because I think many people wasted food because they do not really feel how hard it is to gain the precious food. When people get things without a hitch, they usually do not pay attention to them. So it is important to educate people, giving them climate information.

I definitely believe that we need to take action now. I think that out of everything I have learned from this course and my peers I have met through this course, switching to a vegan diet is undoubtedly the best thing you can do for your health and the environment. The definition of courage is "the ability to do something that frightens one" but I think it should be changed to, "the ability to do the thing one knows is right." For me, the destruction that comes with climate change is far more frightening than changing what I eat. I think everyone knows before they are going to eat meat that they should eat something else, but have resistance to change their habits because it is all they know. An addiction to thought patterns and behaviors is one of the hardest things to break, but doing so is extremely liberating for yourself and the environment. People have become too disconnected with the natural world, and sometimes fail to realize they are not the center of the universe. Satisfying your pallet and protein requirements with a burger is nothing in comparison to the joy of knowing you directly spared the life of an animal and future animals indirectly by reducing your carbon footprint.

I also think that we should definitely act now instead of waiting for an entire population to shift on a deep-rooted cultural change because that might never happen at all. I understand switching to a vegan diet might be a difficult transition for some. I think it’s also just as great if you decide to pick up the vegetarian diet. Both diets are better than consuming meat for sure. I really like your new definition of courage. I feel like you shouldn’t do something that scares you or makes you uncomfortable, but you should definitely do something that’s right. The best way to solve the problem of picking meat is to offer more tastier options than that. To be honest, I didn’t try a veggie burger until last year. I think the sound of it really scared me because I don’t know what it’s made of, but after trying it I’m hooked. Knowing that it provides just as much nutrients as a regular beef patty, I’m relieved that I chose the option that better for our planet. I’m probably one of those that was super disconnected to the natural world up until I started school here at UCSB. I never appreciated the nature and my surrounding until I became an EEMB major. Now, even the slightest change in color in the sky would make me look up and just stare and appreciate it and I hope we will still have the same beautiful sunset ten, twenty, thirty years from now.

I found Kens opening statements that sweeping culture change will be required to prevent a greater climate crisis to be rather concerning, given that many cultures will literally fight wars and die so that their culture can live on. Americans are no acception, refusing the change lifestyles unless required to do so, and often refusing to admit the effects their actions have on the environment. These same individuals will certainly complain about carbon taxes, even as those very taxes help the future generations have a world to live in. In many cases, those complaining about higher taxes are not the poor but the wealthy or middle class, and in many cases they complain about higher taxes for commodities they utilize such as higher gas taxes to maintain the roads they drive or higher property taxes to create better schools for their children to attend. 
<br><br>
 I personally love the idea of a carbon tax that increases over time, as I am open to change and belive that their is a price to pay by those who hurt others, even if the others they hurt are future generations. Unfortunately, Kens other point that electing the right officials is far to relevant at the moment, as our current representatives are to busy making decisions based on which party proposes an issue to make decisions that are relevant to the time, or are payed enough by Big Oil to purposely create gridlock on environmental issues. As voting season is fast approaching, it is essential that the proper individuals are placed in office to represent the actual voice of the people, not the voice of the oil companies. 
<br><br>
 I find the point of America not having its of cuisine persay, rather a edited culmination of other countries dishes, yet with more meat. I would not say that I travel a lot, but I have been to several other countries, and in each the amount of meat per serving was much smaller and there was a far greater variety of meat free options available. In some sense, even food has not been sparred from the idea of American consumerism, as many affluent families buy more than they can use, throw out what is no longer wanted, and buy more expensive meat based food as a demonstration of prosperity.  I will admit that I am not a great fan of a fully plant based diets in most cases, and every now and then a chicken leg or a pork chop can be a wonderful relief from the green operation of vegetables. Yet I also am aware that I only feel this way because fewer vegetable of meat free option are available in my life. I have yet to find a location that sells the meat free “impossible burger” that I was able to buy back home, a patty with the exact taste of a beef burger but plant based. Kens question is one that invokes deeper thought, in a way we all are indeed architects of the future, yet I know Ken is asking if we will build the future we need to sustain ourselves, and I believe I am an architect of that future, yet I do not think it will be built as those giving the contract out for the construction of the future have already sold it to the oil companies, along with the world my generation and all those that follow me will live in.

What you mentioned about how certain cultures would probably fight wars over changing their cultural habits hits pretty close to home for me. As a Mexican-American, I come from a culture that is largely based around having beef for every meal, specifically and what’s worse is that 8 out of 10 times we are consuming dark meats. I became vegetarian for 3 years and when I say that my family was upset and unsupportive is an understatement. I was very strongly reprimanded and encouraged to go back to our customs. I was forced to go back to eating meat because at the time I was only 15 years old and not able to provide my own groceries. So yes, getting people to make small  changes when it comes to their cultural eating habits will not be an easy step to accomplish. But, I do think that it is very possible as long as we, and by that I mean the children belonging to these cultural families, take the necessary steps to beginning these changes.

In the small town I grew up in we were never really educated on climate change. I took ap environmental studies but we didn't really talk about climate change and its effects. We mainly talked about ecosystems and recycling. I had no idea that eating meat was harming the planet. I only thought that it was wrong because of the killing. I didn't know about all the land and water livestock used. I didn't know about all the greenhouse gases released either. I believe that we need to start teaching this stuff as early as elementary school. People need to understand the dangers of the meat industry before it is too late. I wish I would have known sooner, so I could have worked on altering my diet sooner. 
<br><br>
I don't think we have time to sit around and wait for people to simply take action. We have been doing that for years. It's our turn to step up and work hard towards making a change. We need to implement a carbon tax and educate people. I think Denmark's idea for listing the carbon of food labels is extremely smart. It's the perfect way to know exactly how much your food costs.

After watching Ken’s lecture over a climate vanguard, I definitely agree that we need one. We could wait around and see if people will start changing their actions, but we would just be sitting back while the climate is getting warmer. I do agree that we need to do our best to elect officials that care about the climate issue and will take a stand against carbon-producing organizations. I think a carbon tax is a great idea, but I’m not sure how well it would go over here in America. Many people are already struggling to get by with the price of products now, but as carbon taxes become implemented, some might not be able to afford necessities. There are many other ways that we can combat climate change, such as homegrown farms, larger plant-based diets, switching to solar energy, and so on. But for these to become more popular, many need to see their idols do the same. We live in a society where we must be like movie stars and wear what they were and eat what they eat. Therefore, if these people will take their own life choices and manipulate them to be more sustainable, many others would as well. This is why it is important to elect people who are knowledgable about their choices. 
<br><br>

In response to Ken’s question, I think we need to act now. We need influential people to start making changes in their own lifestyles. Where are the pictures of celebrities recycling instead of buying real fur coats? There are many viable options for those with large amounts of cash, such as Tesla. Although this isn’t the best option, it gives them a chance to flaunt their wealth while being somewhat better for the planet. It would be rare to find an A list celebrity or politician riding the bus, but it would be extremely influential if they were.

We absolutely need a climate vanguard and we need one now. The more films or lectures I watch as well as articles I read for this class, the more concerned I am for our future. We need leaders to help pave the way for large scale, sweeping action. In this lecture, Ken described two paths that we can and must take to become climate vanguards. The first path was to elect local and national politicians that will support and enact legislation to mitigate climate change and its impacts. 

<br><br>

The second path was to be more aware of your own environmental impact and change your personal actions and decisions. One example of this is through our food choices. We need to reconsider our current way of eating because it is not sustainable for the planet, for the animals being raised and killed for consumption, or for our health. First, we need to switch to largely plant-based diets. Raising and killing animals for meat is environmentally disastrous. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation, water consumption, deforestation, habitat loss, species extinction and more! Furthermore, the treatment of most livestock is incredibly inhumane and unethical as the animals are forced to live in unsanitary, cramped conditions, are injected with antibiotics, are genetically manipulated, and are murdered at an early age. Finally, eating a largely plant-based diet is beneficial to our health as studies have shown that plant-based diets can lead to lower rates of heart disease, arthritis, diabetes, certain cancers, and the list continues! I have personally been vegetarian for six years and vegan for two and I honestly have never felt better both physically and mentally. We also need to significantly reduce the amount of food we waste. I was shocked to learn that ⅓-½ of the food we produce is wasted at the retail level, through storage/processing/ transportation, and at the consumer level. We need to throw less away and become more creative with what we eat (for instance, leftover carrot stems make for a great pesto). Finally, we need to examine where our food comes from and the carbon footprint associated with it. In the past, I have definitely misjudged the relative amounts that various foods contribute to my carbon footprint. For example, I absolutely love mangos and will eat them year-round. I previously thought that since they were organic they were not bad for the environment. I completely disregarded the fact that in the winter, those mangos must be shipped from far away places like Chile and have a pretty sizable carbon footprint. Also, I had no clue that eating asparagus in the winter is no better for the climate than eating chicken or pork! Therefore, we should focus on eating locally and sustainably grown foods (or even better grow our own food).

Realistically, not only are there a lot of other concerns of the world as a whole, there are infinitely many goals and aspirations for the world and its nations that require attention from society as well. The planet is responding in a frightening way to our unsustainable and consumerist lifestyles, but the reasons for this stemming from so many various sources requires a vast amount of big changes to nations and economies around the world. And developing countries are still working to make their mark on the moon and set up their own satellites in space. And entrepreneurs are still trying to create companies or products or businesses that need economic security and easy-access resources to succeed. And politicians will forever prioritize national safety via military/weapon spending and international relations. Climate change is a big problem, and all of the impacts which stem from it require specific and careful attention in order to mitigate the society around them. There will be no single source in order to kick-start the revolution necessary to move to correct this issue, as a multitude of revolutions are necessary. 
<br><br>

For this reason, I believe every individual should be responsible for their contribution. Regardless of the hopelessness that manifests as we watch corporations and politics continue as they please, our changes at least spread awareness and contribute less to the problem. Each individual makes an impact; So each of their changes shall make an impact as well. Elon Musk is going to continue needlessly manufacturing futuristic contraptions because that's what he cares about. That is going to continue to have a large carbon footprint. But if the city surrounding him is full of vegans, then honestly, maybe it kinda evens out.

I agree with Ken, it is important to map out the future for any population, and when making any map you need someone to draw it. However, it is important when thinking about the future that the position of these so called “climate vanguards” wouldn’t be too controlling. Fearing a nanny state, I feel like many people would hold little respect for the position, and aim to see it taken out of public scope. Particularly in America, people don’t like to be told what to do, which is why I get nervous thinking about a position that lays out what people should be doing. While I feel like mapping the future is incredibly important, I don’t think it should be done in a way that feels too constricting or approaches the idea too “legally”. In a sense, we should try and approach the problem from an education point and an awareness point.
<br><br>

Different from how we do it now, however, I think that we should try and spread information through more realized sources. I think that increased laws on the passing of misinformation about the climate crisis should be put up, I think that more laws pertaining to the teaching of the climate crisis should be put up, (If I had to take two years of Texas history…) I think that a lot more of the advertisements we see in television, newspapers, billboards, etc. should be government sponsored and spread awareness. I don’t, however, feel that we should go directly into the passing of laws that put strict regulation on people’s lives. I fear we’d throw on a 1920’s vibe and have a bit of “bootlegger mentality” about how much meat we still eat, how many tractors we still drive, and how many gallons we get per mile.

I found the beginning of the lecture slightly redundant. I did not really learn anything new related to politics and air travel. It is all interesting information but I feel it is not necessary to reiterate it so many times in different contexts. I am sure the students already understand that flying is terrible and a large portion of their carbon footprint. 
<br><br>
I found the discussion of what people decide to eat interesting. The effects of culture and family on what we eat is something I have never really considered too much. I know that different countries or ethnicities eat differently but never really considered the implications of this or the different effects of the food on the planet. This could definitely also affect the ability of one to alter their diet.
<br><br>
I found the idea that certain vegetables have no better effect on the environment than meat. For example, Ken presents asparagus in the winter as no better than other foods that are not great for the environment. This emphasizes the nuances of dealing with the climate crisis. There is no panacea for this disease, as there is always a different food or form of transportation or energy source that is better in certain scenarios or contexts than others. It is no easy task to face the climate crisis, but learning about the different steps we can take, and acting early can lead to success.

In order to make a significant reduction to the global impacts of climate change the world needs to make swift cultural and lifestyle changes. Those with the greatest carbon footprints need to adjust their lifestyle by consuming food and products more mindfully and taking part in political efforts at change. I think that we do need a bold group of individuals (the climate vanguard) to step forward and start making change rather than waiting on the world to get their heads out of the sand. Many are going to continue to be reluctant and inactive in making personal and global changes without the continual push back from activists. There has been no much denial surrounding the issue for so long that many people are going to have to be scared into action once the negative consequences become overwhelming apparent. In the meantime I think it's important that the younger generations join the climate vanguard and find ways to educate themselves and others while making changes in their daily lives.

After watching this lecture,I aware that  I know very little about food  problem  has a very negative impact on our planet. Although I don't think we can completely correct our bad habits in my generation, I have seen some progress of people. For example, in the past two years, when I learned the details of the climate crisis, I was very cautious about the daily actions that helped reduce the carbon footprint. In order to protect the environment and my personal health, I began to eat less beef. At the same time, I often commute on foot or bike even though I live in Goleta. For me personally, this is the limit of what I can do because a person's power is limited after all. But I believe that if we all do this, the impact will be huge. But self-awareness alone can only solve some superficial problems. If we want to eradicate such problems, we need more power. That's why Ken emphasizes the importance of voting again and again, and voting is one of the real ways to ensure change. I believe that carbon taxes and food labels, which can correctly express the negative impact on the environment, will help to change the status quo. Although this may seem extreme, it is the most feasible way to save our planet.

I absolute agree with you. Personally, I love to eat meat and my family and friends call me “carnivorous animal”. Before attending Ken’s class, I was not aware of the gigantic pollution that can be brought by the meat industry. After Ken’s letter, I began to change. To be honest, it is really hard to change one’s diet habit. For me, having a meal without meat and only vegetables is like torcher, but I start to reduce the amount of meat I eat every meal, especially for beef. I also told my family the negative consequence of meat consumption and they began to reduce, too. Just like you said, personally awareness of conservation is a tiny bit in the world. We need to let more people to know about the consequence of their actions. My family has already installed solar panels on our rooftops and limited the use of plastic bags. It is important to let all people around the world to act now, but I’m afraid that won’t happen. Human will not learn unless something really hurt or struct them. Although the chance to change now is little, it is still necessary and vital to persuade others and act. Just like Ken says, voting a leader who is willing to do environmental conservation is a perfect and plausible thing to do.

Ken’s suggestion of being “architects of the future” is a lofty responsibility. Of course, I would love to say that I want to be one and even that I’m taking steps to becoming one, I just don’t know how much I’m personally capable of. With that said, I am still working on being more environmentally friendly and reducing my carbon footprint. 

<br><br>

I’m a vegetarian, but as Ken mentioned, that in itself isn’t necessarily the best action I can take. I could be vegan, I could be more conscious of where my food originates from so that doesn’t impact my carbon footprint. I’m working on being more environmentally conscious about my food consumption by doing research on certain fruits and vegetables and from where they originate. 
<br><br>


One point that really piqued my interest was Ken’s acknowledgement of the deep connection that culture and food share in our world. What defines a culture? Common language, beliefs, customs, attire, and food. I have a pretty diverse group of friends, and we would all introduce one another to our culture’s foods as a way to partake in community. Food is integral to a culture, and recommending that people should cut down on meat can be seen as an attack on a system of traditions and a way of life. When I decided to switch to a vegetarian diet two years ago, my main struggle was not staying away from meat; rather, it was the difficulty of being able to experience my Filipino culture through food. And if you know anything about Filipino food, there is a TON of meat. However, my mom would do her best to support me and allow me to eat the food I love. She would make pancit without the chicken, fried rice with tofu, and lumpia with veggies. Often, these vegetarian-friendly options still tasted great as well. My situation is proof that it’s possible to experience your culture while eating a plant-based diet – it just takes a bit more creativity.

Agreeably, taking on the task of becoming a role model for sustainable living is a hefty responsibility. There are so many factors that surround evolving to become completely environmentally friendly, from the way you get to work to what you brush your teeth with. 
<br><br>
At the end of the day, there will always be something more that we can do to prevent climate change, always another lifestyle alteration to be made. It is so easy to feel hopeless when being faced against such a massive situation like climate change, knowing that every day you are contributing to this crisis. 
<br><br>
In response to Ken’s question, I think any and all actions taken to combat this crisis are needed. Just like any trend, it takes a few pioneers to bring awareness and begin a movement, especially when people are aware of the need for a change. Take the birth of rock and roll for example. Americans in the 1950s were looking for a change from the conventional, conservative nature of society. Many were drawn to the blues and jazz of the south, which was beginning to explore new, edgier sounds. Musicians such as Little Richard and Buddy Holly were at the forefront of this evolution, and people soon caught on to this new era of music. Because of this music, an entire counter culture was formed and spread quickly across the nation with the help of so many different people bringing awareness to this new sound. So, in short, it takes a couple leaders to form the front of a movement, and lots of support to grow it. The parallel I see with rock and roll and climate change is that recent years have shown a desire for people to be more environmentally conscious (pioneers of this movement would include activists such as Greta Thunberg). Whether that be an effect of more food variety or witnesses effects of natural disasters caused by climate change, recent generations have adopted sustainable trends such as thrifting, tiny house living, and veganism. 
<br><br>
Your experience of being vegetarian in a Filipino family is a great example of how our society is perfectly able to adapt to more sustainable diets while still retaining our cultures and traditions. I believe that the more people show how it is possible to be environmentally conscious while also retaining their cultural identities, the closer we will be to saving our planet



<br><hr>
I really resonated with this comment in a number of ways. 

<br><br>

First, I agree that being the “architects of the future” or the generation of climate vanguards is a big responsibility that rests on our shoulders. After all, I still find it difficult to always be mindful and conscientious about the environmental impacts my actions have. Although I recycle, ride my bike, and conserve water and energy whenever I can, I find myself constantly questioning whether or not I am doing enough on my part, let alone to be a climate vanguard. However, I also think that it is important to recognize this feeling and look for ways in which we can do more as a generation to mitigate the climate crisis. We might think that we, as individuals, have little say or impact in making significant environmental differences. However, who says that it has to be this way? If we all adopt this skeptical and pessimistic mindset, then nothing will be accomplished and no one will be willing to make genuine strides toward mitigating the climate crisis. But, if we all take on the personal responsibility of being a climate vanguard, then it can go a long way. 

<br><br>

Another interesting point that was brought up in both the video and your comment was the need to reinvent our society’s food culture. Although moving everyone to a plant-based diet is completely unrealistic, we can at least make a better effort to encourage non-meat alternatives and better educate the public about the environmental impacts that the meat industry has. Being Filipino myself, I completely agree with you in the fact that Filipino foods contain a lot of meat. With food being an integral part of my culture and family, there is probably no way in getting my parents to stop eating or cooking  meat altogether. However, when it comes to our personal choices, we can all make a better effort in choosing healthier and more sustainable alternatives, as found in a plant-based diet. If we truly are to make a transition in food culture,  we have to educate the public and really make an effort to promote and normalize a plant-based diet; or at least a diet that is less dependent on meat consumption. With this in mind, we can be the “architects of the future” by redefining societal norms and by challenging the hegemonic ideas of consumer culture by normalizing habits that are more environmentally sustainable.

When hearing Ken talk about the typical American meal, I felt nostalgic thinking about my mom's home cooked meals. Although simple, they remind me of the simplicity of childhood and the good times with my family. In these meals, we would have a protein, a carb, vegetables, and a salad. This protein would usually be steak 3 times a week, chicken twice a week, and fish the rest of the week. It wasn't until a few years ago when I realized meat, especially red meat, was extremely harmful to the environment. I would pretend I didn't like it just so my mom would stop integrating it into our diets so much, and it worked; towards the end of high school my parents would cook meals more uncommon to our usual diets. I would encourage them to watch the climate change documentaries and specials that talked about the harmful affects red meat has on our planet, and slowly but surely I am making them more aware of their meat consumption. Just a few weeks ago my mom was telling me about a new recipe she found that incorporated impossible meat, a great meat alternative. I am very proud of my parents for being open minded with something that is so typical in our day to day lives and are willing to do something about it. 
<br><br>
Now, I think about the meals I will make someday for the family I wish to have. I will channel my mom and dad's incredible cooking, yet with a slight twist. By then, I assume animal products will be on the decline and instead of chicken, beef, or fish, we will be having a largely plant-rich diet, which I predict will be the typical diet for many Americans very soon.

After reading many of these comments, I have become aware that many people have a similar story regarding their diet as a child. In my household, our meals often were constructed around a main protein source, often steak or chicken. That is what I ate for 18 years of my life, so I have always believed that was a healthy and sustainable way to eat. Protein sources such as steak and chicken are definitely healthy and easy options, which explains why many families utilize them heavily in their meals. Sadly, the meat industry contributes so much to our current crisis that it is very bad to rely on them so much. I think that many people, such as my family and many others, rely on meat sources of protein because we are not super educated on the impacts of meat. After taking this class and teaching my mom about the beef industries climate footprint, we strive to eat less meat as a family. I think this type of outcome would be very common in many households if everyone was aware how bad the meat industry actually is. I think a lot of people are uneducated about the topic and really don’t know the harm they are causing. We are uneducated because the dairy and meat industry floods the markets with advertising promoting it and the opposite view is not as mainstream.  Most of the time, individuals are not actively seeking information about the climate footprint of meat and so therefore the information we come into contact with is simply promoting and glamorizing the industry. This type of information is not widespread because it would drastically impact the sales of agricultural corporations and they often pay off anyone negatively portraying it. This is why I think that blogs, documentaries, and small news outlets are so crucial because they often present facts as they are without political and monetary influence.

Yes we need a climate vanguard and the first approach to take is to elect government officials as Ken notes in this video, who have good climate change policies. I think Bernie Sanders is a great candidate for this because he is one of the politicians who has really pushed for climate change. His biggest legislative climate accomplishment was a national energy efficiency grant program he introduced and passed in 2007. He also helped push for $3.2 billion for the programs to be included in the Obama administration's 2009 economic recovery package. The grants were the largest investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy at the community level in U.S history. If people really listen to Bernie's message and see what he has planned for our planet they will understand more how effective his ideas will be. Yes we will still be  be needing to force people to change their lifestyle and habits in order to really impact the globe, however if we listen and follow Bernie i believe he will do better than any other candidate and this is where it all begins. Once he has the power he can start making more power moves to help reduce waste and carbon emissions. 
<br><br>

I do not believe I will become vegetarian or vegan myself, however as Ken says "you can begin by doing this at the breakfast table" he means to not necessarily shift to vegetarianism, but to waste less food and just be overall smarter about your diet choices. Others will disregard this and eat what they want, when they want and waste however much they want. To stop this, I do agree with Ken that we need a climate vanguard and we need to act now by putting those like Bernie Sanders in the position of power to help carry out this change.

While I do agree that it is up to my generation to be the “climate vanguards,” I think that it will be difficult to convince people to change their diet. Meat is just so easily accessible and cheap. The way that our economy and culture is set up now makes it difficult for many Americans to avoid meat. This is what leads to ideas of changing our culture or economic system as a whole. While that would be a valiant effort, how feasible would that really be? We cannot just uproot our capitalist society overnight. And would we even want to?

You ask some very interesting questions. How feasible would the idea of changing our culture or economic system as a whole? Would we even want to do that? While ken's call to action is very inspiring, the notion of changing a cemented dietary habit is a difficult task to accomplish by even a progressive generation like ours. A more pragmatic approach for establishing commonplace sustainable diet that combats climate change is to make the issue of climate change such an appealing cause that the majority opts to plan based diet. Arguably, this whole course aimed to present the crisis of climate change as a pressing issue, demanding of your support. But as we can learn from current circumstances (the corona virus), simply because something is important and must be taken serious is not enough to cause action. There must be some type of popularization in the media to make climate change attractive. I know. It's sad to hear that our planet is not important enough for us to do something. But we must accept that we live in a world where viral sensations are the standards to which an issue must meet to cause progressive action. There must be an event that impacts all of us for a change in habits and economic interest to occur. Those are the conditions in which a change to our culture or economic system as a whole could occur.

The video this week was really interesting. I'm glad we got to hear more about how food is affecting the climate as opposed to forms of travel like we've been talking about recently. And furthermore, how the vegan diet isn't 100% productive. Everyone always preached being vegan or vegetarian as the best for the planet, and clearly beef seems to me to be the worst meat in terms of climate change, but the true game changer seems to be eating locally. If we could all eat food that is locally grown and be majority plant based, that seems like it'd be the best for the environment. I like the idea about putting climate facts on food as well, so you can know just how bad eating that food is for the planet, but at the same time, if it's already there, then that doesn't seem like it'd make a huge difference, but would definitely still be good to know. I also like the idea that Ken mentioned about doing academic conferences online, because that honestly seems like a pretty easy fix to do to lower educators' carbon footprints. There's clearly a lot of small steps we could all take individually, but we all need to be on the same page about it, and I like the idea about a group of leaders standing up and igniting this fight against climate change.

I also enjoyed the argument towards eating locally. It isn’t eating meat in itself that is causing many of the environmental problems associated with it, it is the factory farming and mass produced agriculture that produces large amounts of emissions. Before we were able to transport meat anywhere from anywhere in the country, people relied on their local farmers and butchers to get their meat. And this didn’t really cause any problems. There are many small steps that have to be taken by people individually, and eating locally is definitely one of them. Santa Barbara is a good place to try to do this, as we have many weekly farmer’s markets as well as markets such as the Isla Vista Co Op that focus on locally grown, and mainly plant based, foods. I also like the idea of putting “climate facts” on food. The same way we put nutritional information on food, we can’t be expected to know what is in our food unless we are educated. And this is a good way to educate essentially everybody, all they have to do is look at the package.

I also liked the viewpoint of beginning to make sure one’s eating locally instead of kind of putting pressure on people to completely change their diet. It makes a lot of sense how it would help the environment, as locally grown products have very low chances of having a bunch of chemicals and modifications done to them. Not only that, but it would also be very beneficial to the local vendors, farmers, and town. Coming from a small town myself, I know a lot more people would get on board if they knew the impact they had by doing the small things. 
<br><br>
With the elections coming up, I feel like it’s now the best time to be studying this. It will be my first time being able to vote and I look forward to putting in the efforts on researching the candidates and who advocates on climate change policies and who is/isn’t funded by destructive companies such as big oil industries.

<br><Hr>
thank you for pointing out how locally grown products are really important to help reduce the climate crisis. Ken briefly talks about this and I think deserves a little more attention. He points out how some vegetables are flown in during some seasons which raises the carbon footprint of that product more so than the production of meat. The thing that Denmark is doing to help people be aware of the carbon impact is really progressive. I just wanted to say that pointing out how locally grown food makes a difference on people’s carbon footprint is something that we could have easily overlooked in this video. Good job for bringing it up again in the comments.

After watching the video, the first sentence that ken said is that many Americans would not want to make a personal change.” To be honest, not only Americans, most people in the world have realized the climate crisis but feel lazy and not motivated to change including me. It is so hard for people to change by living in a convenient and comfortable environment. We can eat delicious meat, drive a car to work and travel, and have all the convenience created by electricity. If the big environment can change and cultivate a green-life atmosphere, it gets much easier for people to adapt to an environmental life. 
<br><br>
Also, the suggestions that ken advises is useful. Voting for candidates who support climate crisis and implement programs pricing carbon. Pricing carbon is also a good solution to reduce carbon emissions. Plus, we can waste less food and change to a plant-based diet which is best choice for human beings to protect the earth. These are all essential and critical actions for changing the environment. The point is that every one of us can be aware of it and can really make a change quickly.

<p>
We can’t wait for others to realize the change we have to make. We have to act now, more than ever, even if people still aren’t on board, those who already are need to continue to advocate for what Ken mentions as the climate Vanguard. One of the main points that stood out to me within this lecture was that simply going vegetarian or going vegan isn’t going to help a whole lot, it may be somewhat a worse thing you could do than someone who eats meat once a week. I was partly confused by this, until Ken pointed out how aware we need to be aware where our food comes from, where certain articles of clothing come from, your personal items at home, it’s something I will definitely inform myself more of the types of products and food I purchase that impact the climate. I’m probably not the only one though, many other people need to educate themselves on this, the solution of incorporating climate change tags on food seems like a good alternative solution in making consumers aware of where the foods they buy comes from. Informing the public about where our food comes from by using climate change tags in supermarkets will create a dramatic change. Especially now that elections are coming up, Ken makes a good point to elect people who advocate for policies on climate change.

I do believe that we need to make sure that our food habits, as well as what our policy makers decide, needs to change. Yet, as we have seen during the different videos and documentaries that we have watched, the carbon emissions that are made by these large industries are happening because politicians are being funded by these corporations. We have seen, even recently during “Cowspiracy”, that the agricultural business is huge and that it is almost impossible to take down because they hold so much money and influence within our government.

<br><br>

Yet, let’s not act surprised when we hear these revelations; don’t get it twisted. Corporations continue to run politics, and it has been like this for a long time. A recent example is gun-control and the NRA. The NRA is sponsored by many of the rifle companies, and they are feeding money to these political institutions in order to put into effect policies that help those corporations; it is a cycle of beneficiaries. How can we change that? Donate. A lot of the time, politicians take this money because they need funding for their campaigns, and the more money that they have, the more secure they will feel. Because the corporations will always give up much more than the general public will, it will be impossible to help and fund politicians that have innovative solutions and can actually pass bills. Yes, there are relatively more successful politicians than have left-wing ideas, especially towards climate change, that make a lot of noise. But, why hasn’t our government reflected that? Why are bills not passed? Because money is louder than ideas. 

<br><br>

We need to stand up and actually support politicians that have real ideas for real change within our system. We cannot watch while the rest of the world suffers. As the so-called greatest country on Earth, we must do the best job that we can to take charge; take lead; take initiative. We must be the leader of this world, and taking a stand against climate change will no doubtedly show that. This is a global crisis, and our position and power can turn the tables and begin a process of hope.

I agreed with a lot of the points that you made throughout your comment and you brought up some very interesting points. I believe that we cannot wait for everyone to realize that this is an important problem and the solution is going to require us all to make some significant sacrifices. A great and effective way to start solving this problem is to start electing officials that focus on the climate crisis and are committed to creating policies that will help, as Ken mentioned in the video. I also found it interesting that going vegetarian or vegan was not all that effective, because in the reading and the movie for this week, one of the main points was that we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint if we were to switch to a plant based diet. It wasn't until Ken brought up that most of the vegetables are flown in from other countries and since flying is that fastest way to release the most carbon into the atmosphere, when we switch to a plant-based diet it is most likely that those vegetables caused just as much carbon emissions as beef does. I think that Denmark's idea of creating a label that is similar to the nutrients label on foods, but instead informs consumers of their foods environmental impact. This method would help educate consumers of their impact on the environment.
<br><hr>
When Ken mentioned that a plant based diet may be just as harmful as eating meat about once a week I was also quite surprised. I never considered just how impactful the issue of importing produce is in terms of emissions because it is not something that is discussed very often. Food is something that tends to be pushed to the back burner when people discuss climate change because it does not seem to be on the same scale as flying or driving, when in reality food consumption is a huge issue. When people say that they are going to start eating a plant based diet for environmental reasons I assume that they are doing all that they can, but now I realize that even this climate conscious practice can cause issues if consumption is not carefully monitored. More and more people are becoming aware of how harmful it is to shop at fast fashion stores because among other reasons, the clothes are being imported to America, but we are still going to the grocery store and buying out of season produce without much thought. It would be incredibly helpful if America would adopt the same method of climate labels that they are beginning to implement in Denmark, not only for food but for other products such as clothing as well. If people are faced with a clear picture of how much CO2 was emitted for them to have that asparagus or that shirt they may be more mindful of what they buy. If this practice became widespread, eventually grocery stores and clothing stores would be faced with the consumers making a change that limits their sales, and they will be forced to make changes along with their customers. 
<br><br>

Another helpful solution to combating the issue of not knowing where our food is coming from would be to shop at farmer’s markets as often as possible. With farmers markets the vendors tend to be local farmers that grow what is in season and typically will label produce with where it was grown. Farmers markets typically have vendors for other goods as well, so it makes it easy to shop local for other things such as clothing. Along with this, farm to table restaurants are becoming increasingly popular because it makes it easy to know where your food is coming from even with someone else cooking it. When we go to restaurants it can be easy to consume the food without thinking about where it came from because typically when we eat at a restaurant rather than cooking something ourselves it is for convenience. We cannot reasonably allow ourselves to become complacent in our own kitchens or at restaurants if we want to lead the way to a more sustainable future even if it is difficult to do so and means sacrifices have to be made. 

<br><br>
I also strongly agree with your point that everyone who can vote, needs to vote, and needs to do so with careful consideration. While we can all do our best to work towards the ultimate goal of ethical consumption, this is made a great deal more difficult if the laws that are being made are not in line with our goals. While I am sure some small grocery stores would take up the practice of making climate labels, large chains are likely to avoid this unless there is policy in place that enforces it. As consumers we hold the power of choosing where we shop, but more often than not corporations and a lack of government regulation are unfortunately more powerful. To combat this we desperately need to vote and hope that our elected officials will stand for the changes that are essential to saving our planet.

At the beginning of the lecture when Ken talked about flying, it really stuck out to me that the issues he was facing because of his decision not to fly anymore was a "problem of the future." It is just crazy to me how very little people are taking it upon themselves to navigate these issues, while others do completely nothing and will have to change their ways in the future because they couldn't put the extra effort in now. I found it really interesting that Ken grew up eating a lot of meat because of where he lived and the Italian culture, but when in reality in the Mediterranean they do not eat nearly as much meat. I never realized that meat was something idealized in the U.S, whether we agree with it or not. I am Mexican and have grown up in a traditional household where we consume meat everyday. When I go home and go to family gatherings and explain to everyone that I consume little meat they all sort of laugh and don't really understand. I thought the adding of climate labels to food packaging would be very eye opening, and would make people more aware of what they are doing to the planet just by eating. I believe that it is our duty to act now against climate change since we are educated and aware. I think waiting for everyone else to jump on board would just be selfish of us.

Yeah, I really like the idea of having climate labels on food packaging to try to educate the general public on how their food choices are affecting the environment. I really do not think that eating meat is a problem. The biggest problem is the amount of meat we eat and the type of meat we eat. Meat has become an everyday staple of American life when it should instead be a once in a while occasion for special events or as a treat. It should not be so common to eat meat everyday. I think that having labels on packaging just like some countries have warnings on cigarettes and pictures of scarred lungs in order deter smokers, I would love to have pictures of the chicken and a name on the package of meat in order to at least try to deter meat eaters. I also think it would help to have ads featuring people who are actually farmers. People who have a common perception of life with many middle and working class people. I think this would have much more of an effect on the perception of meat eating by meat eater than having some politician or scientist to tell them to stop eating meat. I think we are being far too passive in the approach to trying to get people to stop eating meat and it is going to cost us a lot in our effort to combat climate change.

What I enjoy about Ken's lectures are that he is clear about what big or small actions need to be taken in order to combat the climate crisis on both the macro and micro scales. Adopting a primarily plant-based diet is a familiar concept to me and I have already gradually begun to make the shift with no detriment to myself. While I agree that our generation needs to take matters into our own hands because we simply do not have enough time to wait for others to see the danger for themselves and finally act as a united front, I think that the "vanguard" that Ken mentions is a different matter. In order for something like a vanguard to be successful, we need to change our behavior and redefine our values so that we match the urgency of the climate crisis. The second point in particular is especially important: if we do not prioritize the planet and our future, then we will be no better than members of the older generation who do not believe in the climate crisis. It is difficult to exploit something that you strongly believe in, after all. There would be less wiggle room for people to potentially take climate activism and twist it into something dishonorable if the believers of the cause personally share similar ideas across the board.

I think changing our diets to be largely plant based as well as wasting less food is one of the easiest ways to reduce personal carbon footprints. If enough people do this, of course it will make some difference. If it will make any meaningful, noticeable difference, I can not be too sure. If people are not forced to eat less meat or just do not care enough to change their eating habits to reduce their footprint, this will have very little effect, if any at all. While it is something that can be personally done, I think it is another one of those "look at me, im better than you because I dont eat meat and am not killing the planet" type of deals. 

<br><br>

I have been vegetarian for as long as I can remember because of my parents are. I continue to not eat meat because I grew up without it and just do not like the taste and think it is absolutely disgusting to be eating bits and pieces of an animal from who knows where. I have also seen the process of how meat is made, similar to conspiracy, and it makes me sick. I do not understand how people can see those videos and still just go out and eat it. Maybe if enough people stop eating so much meat and the meat industry is forced to change, a difference will be made, but I am skeptical of its impact.

I feel that a climate vanguard is important, and we definitely not only need one but more activists around the world to speak for the climate issue, so that more people can be influenced.
<br><br>
I really agree with the point that Ken made several times in this video, which is that many people won't make changes until they are required to do so. Rather than being a result of a compulsory act, I feel it might have something to do with collective actions. We are heavily influenced by people and the environment that surround us. At least I am influenced that way.  After reading the "Summary of Solutions", I am fully aware of how changing the food I waste and changing my diet can do so much to the environment. However,  I still grab the meat-based meals in the dining halls and try to not feel guilty by seeing how everyone else is still eating meat. Sometimes I just wish that if more of the people I know are taking initiatives to protect the environment, then I'll definitely join them.  
<br><br>
It's a reality that not everyone can be a vanguard or suitable to be. That's why I love the idea of the carbon tax and climate labels. They give everyone a motivation to think before making their decisions so that they have no reason to ignore their potential impact on the planet.

<p>
I agree with Ken’s lecture action should be taken now or there will be no change. There are many strategies proposed in an attempt to mitigate the climate crisis. While all ideas are commendable, what will prove to be the most efficient is directing focus on lifestyle changes to reduce emissions. While there are many feasible ideas, they will all have to be extremely ambitious. Transportation, travel, buildings, and homes will need to make significant improvements. Companies and homeowners will have to switch to more renewable sources of energy such as solar to cut emissions. This is a more realistic approach since regulating large corporations will require too much political and economic change which people are not ready to give up. This ambitious standpoint for transportation as well as lifestyle changes are necessary, places such as Copenhagen and Japan who rely on public transportation systems, have already successfully transitioned to fewer cars. As they took away resources from roads and put them towards transportation systems, they have ultimately reduced the carbon footprint from mass amounts of cars on the roads proving this to be an effective strategy. While yes, lifestyle changes may inconvenience us, we need to understand that these consequences of inaction will become much worse if we are not willing to change our way of life. These small changes will ultimately help us stay under the safe climate warming limit which is why it is important to make the switch to greener energy. The truth is, if we do not stick to these strategies and continue at this rate it will be not only a problem for our future generations, but a problem for us now.

I absolutely think that we need action and we need it right now. If we wait around for the rest of the world, it will simply be way too late. We need both powerful people, like government officials and famous influencers, to make differences using their platforms as well as everyday people to change their actions and lead by example. We need people to continue to educate and hold others accountable. Nothing changes if nothing changes. I have been vegetarian for 9 months now and I love how now, almost everywhere I go out to eat has vegetarian and vegan friendly options. I think that eating to benefit the climate is so important, not only for the planet but for our own health as well. Eating seasonally and locally is just as important as eating plant based. Lately I have been going to the farmers market as much as possible and trying to eat with the seasons. I love telling my friends about the new vegetarian meal I made or snacks I eat. I have also been lucky enough to begin to influence my family and now my mom tries to make vegetarian dishes a lot more frequently for herself. This movement is not going to go anywhere if passionate people do not continue to educate people and lead by example. We can not afford to wait, and yes it might be hard, but really not as hard as people think. I also think it is so interesting and backwards how now it is way more expensive to eat healthy. I feel like ordering a salad can sometimes be way more expensive than a meat option. This is so backwards because now some people can not afford nutritious healthy foods and are forced to resort to fast food processed meat options. This is why it is so important for politicians to be responsible and promote food security and take time and effort to improve the local food systems and promote healthy eating.

Because of how I was raised and where I grew up, I personally found that switching to a completely or heavily plant based diet very difficult. However, switching to a less meat diet would be a better plan I would take in order to reduce my carbon emission from consuming meat. I also find convincing my parents to make change in their diet even harder because they have been eating the same way for at least 40 years. One thing I appreciate is that my family doesn’t allow food to be wasted, my parents always teach me and my siblings to finish what we have in our bow before we have another dish. 
<br><br>
Even though it might be hard for us and largely impossible for the generation before us to change to a more plant based diet and consume less meat, the good news is that we recognized the problem and are gaining more concern.

I understand how you feel, I also think one of the most difficult things to do that Prof. Hiltner stated is switching to a plant-based diet. For me, this is the thing that increases my carbon footprint because I do not fly or drive. Prof. Hiltner brought up the issue I feel I will have if I mention switching my entire diet and not consuming any meat to my family. I come from a Mexican family, where nearly every meal involves some sort of meat. When I was around 6, I saw a goat being killed and skinned to prepare for a family party we were having. After watching that, for years I refused to eat any meat unless someone tricked me. At family reunions, I would not eat because all of the dishes would involve some type of meat and my mother would be judged as a bad parent for allowing me to be “so disrespectful” by not eating the food. There were many instances where I was forced to “eat what I was given”. After a couple years of this treatment, I began to slowly eat more meat just to appease them and I regret returning to meat because I feel it will be harder now to stop eating certain dishes. 
<br><br>
I do think that it would be very beneficial to the price of a carbon tax on products that require the emission of greenhouse gases. This may force some people to stop flying or eating meat because they can not afford to pay for it. At the same time, I keep thinking of the backlash these types of policies would receive from people on any end of the spectrum since it would affect everyone.





</span></div><hr>


<p>
In response to Ken’s questions at the end of the lecture video, we should act now instead of waiting for everyone else to start taking action because then it will be too late as the climate crisis would already be more than ready to destroy our planets. All of us should be climate vanguard because we are not only doing this for ourselves but also for countless other lives and species with whom we share this beautiful planet with and also for our descendants and future generations. However, it is a sad and unfortunate truth that most people will not start taking actions to mitigate climate change until they are being forced to because we as humans like comforts and convenience in our lives and removing those comforts from our lives, such as boycotting air travel, would be extremely difficult simply because many prefer the convenience, socio-economic status and comforts associated with flying. 

<br><br>

One interesting point Ken brought up during the lecture video is the Americanization of cuisines and food originated from all over the world in the U.S. through the addition of meat, particularly beef, in the diet. It is amazing to me to see how beef is so ingrained in the American culture and societal values that it is omnipresent in every restaurant in the U.S. no matter what kinds of culture the restaurants are based upon. Just like how Ken explained it, when food of different cultures and from all over the world arrive in the U.S. as a result of immigration, those types of food all become Americanized in a way that meat, especially beef, start appearing in the menu or on the side of those food dishes. Take Panda Express as an example: when I first came to the U.S. from China the first restaurant I visited was Panda Express because it claims that it is making Chinese food, but after trying it I realized that it is apparently not making the actual traditional Chinese food because there was so much meat in it. Almost every side dish contains some sorts of meat, such as beef and chicken, and there are only one or two side dishes that consist of purely vegetables. Panda Express provides an example of the Americanization of Chinese food because traditional Chinese food does not contain so much meat and mostly consists of vegetables. But when it arrived in the U.S., the restaurant had to make changes in their menu in order to adapt to the mainstream American culture and to appeal to the preference of the general American public, and that was when meat came into play. Therefore, switching to a largely plant-based diet can be an effort for people to trace back and rediscover their cultural origin and heritage as they are able to explore the authentic food from their cultures. 
<br><br>


Additionally, another surprising point brought up by Ken during the lecture video is how a completely vegetarian diet might not be beneficial to the planet as we imagine either. Ken mentioned that eating Asparagus in winter is not much better than eating meat because Asparagus grows in South American and has to be carried through air travel into the U.S., and this was a point that I never knew before watching this video. With this example it is starting to make sense to me as to why Ken always stresses a “largely” plant-based diet, meaning that a diet consisting predominantly of vegetables but not all of vegetables because only eating vegetables might not benefit our climate as shown by the asparagus example. We tend to think that a completely vegetarian diet would be so much more beneficial to the planet and the environment because it contains no meat, but we never take the time to pause and think whether a totally vegetarian diet is truly beneficial to our environment such as this asparagus example. 
<br><br>


Lastly, going back to the questions Ken asked in the lecture video, I don’t think there is any doubt that actions need to be taken to address the climate crisis right here right now because climate change is already well under its way to negatively affecting our planet and all of its dependent lives including ourselves, and we should do everything we can to alleviate this crisis and hopefully stop it in its track before everything is too late and our environment is already being destructed. The protection of our environment needs to start with ourselves and our own actions.

I agree that we should not be waiting for the rest of the world to act. If people continue to wait, then it could be decades (probably longer) before everyone is on board. Like Ken said, meat is a large part of many cultures, so an entire shift in that culture needs to be changed. I am not very optimistic that a culture, which has been influenced by past generations, will change with the presence of climate vanguards. American culture, which has only been developed for a couple hundred of years, has a huge dependence on meat. My father, who grew up in Greece, rarely ate meat. Meat was not a large part of ancient Greek culture nor was it a huge part of modern Greek culture, though it has becoming more prevalent in recent years. My father cooks many of the Greek dishes he ate growing up including lentils, stuffed peppers, dolmades, spanakopita, none of which contain meat. So, eating less meat, or not eating it at all, is entirely possible. Climate vanguards could promote the movement to eat less meat. I watched a TED talk where the second person in the movement is more of a leader than the first person because he was the first follower. The first follower provides the opportunity for a more hesitant follow to also join. That’s how I envision the climate movement. After the first follower joins, many more people will also. However, I don’t envision the movement being large enough to change the entire world. So, as Ken alluded to, legislation to change the culture of diet is necessary if the world wants to make traceable progress.

It is troublesome to leave things behind. If we expect to solve climate change in the future, we are making exactly the same mistake as the previous generation. Slowing down global warming is a mission with no deadline. Many scientists suggested that a 380 ppm Co2 will result in a disastrous future. Yet we are now at 415 ppm. There is not a single institution in this world that can set a clear benchmark for when the entire earth needs to work together to fight climate change. I am afraid by the time we realized that we have to act, it would be too late for everything. 
<br><br>


“We do not have to act right now”, “someone else will step up”, “just do it tomorrow”. There are just so many excuses for procrastination. We can trick ourselves to believe that even if what we are doing is evil, we are still good people. When we are not being helpful to this planet, we tend to fall into cognitive dissonance, a state in which your behavior and your belief contradict. How many times did you ignore a poor homeless kid begging for a penny? What did you say to yourself after ignoring or refusing to that person? Most of the time I tell myself that I might go to donate some money to the charity to save more homeless people instead of just saving one person. Similarly, I thought if I take buses to go around which can lower my carbon footprint, I might be environmentally eligible to travel by air. Such ideas are called “false justification” by Dr. Richard Oppenlander in the documentary “Cowspiracy”. Being less harmful does not mean that we are being helpful to this planet.

Professor Hiltner poses the question at the end of his lecture whether we should begin acting now or wait until everyone is on board to start fighting climate change. That answer is easy we need to start now. The truth of the matter is not everyone will be on board ever, there will always be climate change deniers so it would be silly for us to wait for people to come around. Even our current President has made it clear that climate change is a hoax and should be the least of our concern. One of the main facets Professor Hiltner addresses in this lecture is the need to vote in politicians that support climate activism. This is especially important now in the midst of the 2020 presidential election. I think it is extremely important to note the difference between personal choices and government decisions. On a personal level people could choose to own less stuff, use public transportation, change to a plant based diet, but we can not fight climate change solely on a personal level, we need politicians. We need politicians to vote for carbon taxes which would directly impact fossil fuel suppliers. In turn, reducing the amount of people who fly due to the steep prices. We need politicians to provide the infrastructure and funding for public, mass transportation, in turn lowering our CO2 production. There’s a lot of things we can choose to change about our lifestyle but we also need the help from the government to implement more drastic changes that need to be brought about.

Growing up I have always been surrounded by the practice of food waste which is sadly all too common all over the world. I was raised to believe that wasting food was wrong due to the effort and time that had gone into producing it as well as the cost, so it was either buy only what you know you can eat or don't eat at all. However, everywhere I go I see the effects of food waste. In the dining halls at UCSB I see many people pick up a plate of food only to pick slightly at it and throw it away, and even I admittedly have done so on the days when nothing on the menu appeals to me but I don't want to waste a meal swipe. Even now, in my apartment I am not too responsible when it comes to maintaining my fridge meaning that food can go bad fast in there without me even realizing it was there, meaning food has to be thrown out eventually when it's no longer edible. It truly is difficult to live sustainably now more than ever due to the immense availability and accessibility of food, with people often buying more than needed to sustain them when buying groceries and food leading to more waste. There needs to be a  push in education for sustainable eating practices and lifestyles honestly in order to combat this. I have heard of zero waste stores in the news a couple times where no bags or containers are given to customers, who must bring in reusable supplies to carry raw foods like nuts, fruits, and things that usually are packaged. I feel like if more stores adopt policies such as this, it would vastly cut down on the amount of waste that comes with buying food and also many people would reevaluate how much food they actually need instead of getting bulk items dictated by the store.

In the lecture, Ken emphasizes on very important aspects of climate change that people can adapt to if we pay attention and care about the environment. One of the most important aspects is flying (airplanes). Flying is one of the most convenient options for transportation across the globe. Although it is ver convenient and beneficial for the people, it is unfortunately causing so much damage on our environment. It releases too much carbon gas into the atmosphere. I hope that scientists can figure out a more sustainable option instead of flying because if people don't realize and take action about this issue, there will be more carbon gas emissions in the atmosphere, which ultimately will lead to the death of our planet. In addition to flying, Ken addresses the problems about food waste. I learned that people, including myself, should be aware of our actions leading to food waste, and be smart about our responsibilities. We should only purchase the food and ingredients that we will for sure utilize and eat. It is extremely unfortunate how much consequences our planet suffers from all the food waste caused by human beings.

I agree with your comment. I feel that many people find air travel to be very convenient and this is mainly why people choose to fly. I also hope that scientists find a more sustainable option as well, but I also feel that the carbon tax would also be very effective in reducing flying. Air travel is already expensive as it is. Like Ken stated in previous lectures 19/20 people will never set foot in a plane. If  a carbon tax were to be introduced, then there would be more people. I also feel that train travel and bus are also good alternatives, but I do understand that airplane travel is still a more convenient option for most people. I also agree that is very unfortunate all the food we waste because there are so many people on earth who are starving and we just end up throwing away food. I feel that we need to only purchase as much as we know we will be able to eat. I know of many people who buy things in bulk because of sales and the food end up going to waste anyway so it was not really a deal if people are only consuming the original price worth of food. I liked the idea in the lecture about putting how much the food product is harming the planet on the nutritional label. I feel that this would be very effective because it may stop consumers from buying that certain food. However, I also feel that we need to teach consumers to look at the food labels of the foods they are eating. I don't know if this is just me, but I used to not make a habit of checking the food label until last quarter when I took nutrition and health. If this is the case for many people then this nutritional label idea may not be an effective one.

When I saw the title, I was not sure what a climate vanguard meant. I had to look up what vanguard meant to understand the theme of this film. I thought it was interesting how Ken brought up a point that adding a carbon tax would eventually have people stop flying. I think the motives are great, but I am just not sure how exactly we could regulate how much carbon each person is emitting. In the lecture film about air travel, I wondered just how realistic it was to stop flying and I loved how Ken addressed it in this video. It was interesting how Ken decided to just stop attending national conferences. It was nice to hear how he put an effort to do video calls, but was very blunt how he felt people would not do it. It was for Ken to state how it will realistically take a lot of time and experiments before we figure out the best way to do traveless conferences. I agree that the American public is not really going to do anything about climate change unless they are really forced to. People, including me, have to start to actually make sacrifices to help our planet. It is going to take a lot of time but I am hopeful for the future. 
<br><br>
I like the balance of Ken talking about flying and how we eat. I never thought eating meat was a sign of affluence. It was interesting how he mentioned that food is a cultural thing but eating meat is an American thing. People will always argue against why they can not quit meat. But there are many solutions but require more work. I agree with Ken that we must act now regardless if “everyone else” is not on board.

When Ken decided to stop flying to conferences, I thought that was a really admirable move because he knows how much carbon emission is emitted to the atmosphere for one round trip. I think Ken should have a mini-lecture for professors on campus to educate themselves on their carbon footprint due to traveling for conferences when they can always do a virtual, through the screen type of conference. I think he should advocate for this to be mandatory because some professors might not know what they’re doing wrong and how they are also contributing to the carbon emission even if they change their diets or switch to solar panels. When Ken talked about stop flying in general, it made me feel guilty because my goal was to travel the world but my plans are now at a halt because I learned through Ken’s lecture that my carbon footprint would contribute so much to climate change. It made me realize that I shouldn’t be selfish and want to do something for myself while it harms the planet and others who are living within. 
<br><br>


When people learn about something negative, they don’t change immediately because they’re just so used to what they have been eating and don’t want to change their habits. I think this is a good time for them to understand that they don’t have time to hesitate about their actions and changes need to occur now in order for a future. I don’t know how many times I heard Ken say change must happen now before it’s too late. It is already too late but anything at this point helps.

The thing I found most interesting about this lecture is the idea Denmark is acting on of “climate labels”. People tend to use nutrition labels on their food products to determine if it is healthy and safe to put in their bodies. The same could be effective with climate levels to help people determine if the product they are purchasing is safe and healthy for our planet, which is important for our health as human beings. The labels should not only tell you about the emissions emitted while producing the product, but also those emitted while importing the product. To be even more effective they could include information about the working conditions of the people producing the products. Climate labels could also be used on other products, like clothing. Having just learned a lot about the fast fashion industry, and watching “The True Cost”, I feel like putting labels on cheap articles of clothing about the impact that the clothes they are buying has on the environment will help that person rethink purchasing the item. 
<br><br>
 I found the fact that a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet is actually more greenhouse gas intensive than a diet that consumes only animal based products once a day is surprising to me and kind of hard to believe. However, this just shows us that even if we are vegetarian or vegan, that really doesn’t make us the “ultimate environmentalist.” I feel like a lot of people are boastful about the fact that they are vegan or vegetarian and that they are doing everything they can just by changing their diet, but in reality there is still much more we all can do. Everyone has room to improve and better themselves everyday for the sake of our planet.

The thing I also found most interesting while watching this lecture was the idea of showing the carbon emission of a product on the nutritional label on a food item. I agree with you in that this could be a very effective way in not only educating people on just how bad the food industry is on the environment, but also encouraging people to only buy food with very little carbon emission. I think you make a great point in that we should include the carbon emission on food, clothing, and any manufactured item that is sold in stores. I think it is our social right to know just how bad what we are buying is for the environment so we can shop smart and only buy items that have a very low carbon emission. It is interesting that some sort of vegetarianism is worse for the environment than eating a meat based diet, but this is good information to know because it shows that we not only should cut meat out entirely, but we also need to be more aware of the produce we buy and consume on a seasonal basis. A major issue to our society is that many people are left in the dark on just how bad the food industry (and many other industries too) are on our environment. I believe that by adding these “climate labels” we will be educating a vast amount of people who didn't know how detrimental the food they eat is. Additionally, I think it will change the way people behave in not only the ways that they eat, but also by seeing how much CO2 is being released just from eating people will hopefully be persuaded to stop air travel and do as much as they can to combat climate change.

Food is a fundamental aspect of our lives, and we simply cannot live without constantly fueling ourselves. When Ken asks if we are the "architects" of the future, I began to question what I am doing to help solve the climate crisis. I believe that switching to a plant based diet is an important step towards the right direction. I began eating vegetarian once or twice a week, and hopefully eat more plant based meals. 
<br><br>
I believe that taking small steps are more important than taking drastic and unsustainable lifestyle changes.

I agree with Ken that we should be acting now instead of waiting to take action. As he mentioned, I do not think that most people will make changes to their daily lives unless they are forced to. Some people today do not even want to admit that climate change is real, and many of them are the people in charge of enacting legislation (why it is important to go out and vote). People tend to be selfish and do what is easiest for themselves and do not react to situations until it is too late. By having laws put in place, people will be forced to act now and we need to act now. The more time we take to take action, the worse it's going to be. The only problem with a carbon tax, is that the wealthy will still be able to do whatever they want like travel and eat meat, since they are able to afford it.
<br><br>
I agree that food is very important, as it does brings people together and is telling of how one grew up. It was interesting to hear how a lot of foods have been Americanized to include more meat because meat shows wealth. Since taking this class, I have made changes to my diet and I have started to eat more plant-based and have been decreasing my meat intake. It has not been easy, but the benefits for myself and the planet are worth it.

When people talk about Climate crisis in general, it sounds like a vague yet huge problem that everyone is aware of yet don’t know how to start tackling it. When we narrow what we can do about it down to its quintessences, it is as simple as three words -- start acting now. The urgency of the issue is definitely not a strange guest to us at this point of the class. However, not everyone has the courage and dedication to act upon it. I remember a quote from my favorite TV show Altered Carbon that says “the anger against injustice is universal, but the courage to take action is not”. I find this drawing some parallelism towards the issue of climate change, especially those who are well aware of the potential disaster Climate change can bring upon us. Yes, it is a big commitment and it would definitely cut off some aspects of our personal pleasure. I had never been a vegetarian or vegan for my whole life, and as an out of state student, travelling, especially by air, is a big part of my life too. I think a good way for me to start reducing our carbon footprint, as applicable for others in my shoes too, is to start trying a vegetarian diet once or twice a week to try it out. I am glad that from day to day School dining comms offer whole-cafeteria vegetarian options, as it would be more friendly to both vegetarians and the environment. Even tho, food waste can be quite an issue. I have seen people quite frequently bring their whole untouched food to return as its quite upsetting, as I believe this is quite an issue with an all-you-can-eat cafe. I believe this would be a good aspect for UCSB to start addressing next to trying to reach 0-carbon emission.

Although the dining commons carry vegetarian options, the quality of these is not nearly as good as the rest of the food. The steamed vegetables are hard and outright disgraceful and the salad ingredients have a long way to come. Additionally, some of the vegan and vegetarian options are really concerning nutritionally. I recently switched to black bean burgers at DLG because they were supposed to be better for the climate and healthier. I looked up the nutritional facts at the DLG website and their sodium content is six times greater than a regular Burger. Similarly, the vegan turnovers and some deserts also contained absurd amount of sodium. 
<br><br>


There are somewhat healthy options such as the pasta, pizza, rice/beans, and vegetable quesadilla, but these are only four consistent foods. Maybe add two occasional meals at Blue Plate, and you got five meals. I don't know about you but after seven weeks of just eating these, I am pretty burnt out. I would not say that the dining commons, at least DLG, has reliable vegan options and would argue for the necessity of a reinvention of the vegetarian options. We don't necessarily need more options, but rather turn existing ones into quality items. For example rather than get the cheapest black bean burger patties (I looked them up, they are), get ones that won't give students a heart attack. Additionally, how hard could it be to steam vegetables? I don't know how they screw them up so badly but every time the broccoli is either chewy (wtf) or hard as a rock. Also the implementation of other veggies that can be eaten by themselves such as grilled asparagus, kale or even seaweed would be great.
<br><br>


I personally have found it very hard to follow a plant based diet at the dining commons, I would love to hear your weekly meal routine if at all possible.

Ken points out that there is something people can do from a personal approach to mitigate CO2 emissions. For example, people can choose to not take airplane. Also, they can choose to eat plant-based food. The technology ensures people can contact each other online. Therefore, people can have conferences online instead of going to a particular place, and it is not necessary to take an airplane for business travel. People can negotiate with others through the Internet. Furthermore, meat is not good for health. People can survive without eating meat, but people will be sick if they only eat meat. 
 <br><br>
    However, there are lots of problems that can not be solved from a personal approach, so we need to convince politicians to regulate CO2 emission. The carbon tax is a great way to restrain the CO2 emission. People will less often drive their cars and will choose to take mass transportation. Moreover, the price of taking an airplane will increase dramatically, so there will be fewer and fewer people take airplanes.
   <br><br>
  In my perspective, we need a climate vanguard who should lead us to mitigate the climate crisis. We should not wait until the disasters take place. We need to take action now.

In this lecture video, Ken took his own experience of not flying to the conferences as an example of making changes in order to reduce our footprints. I really do respect that he could sacrifice this much to make changes, because, to be honest, I am still not sure I can do the similar changes to my life. One of the most striking words he said is “Most people will not change until they are required to do so.” I feel sad when I realize this is exactly the truth of our current attitude toward the climate changes. After watching the lecture video, I concluded and simplify the list of actions we can do to fight against climate change on the basis of what we have learned so far in this course:
 <br><br>
1. Unite for bold climate action
 <br><br>
2. Use energy wisely
 <br><br>
3. Get charged up with renewables
 <br><br>
4. Eat for a climate-stable planet
 <br><br>
5. Start a climate conversation
 <br><br>
6. Green your commute
 <br><br>
7. Consume less, waste less
 <br><br>
8. Get politically active and vote
 <br><br>

People now have to start making changes to protect our environment as individuals.

Both you and Ken are right in regards to the truth of whether or not people are able and willing to change their behavior. We won't change unless we are required to do so and I am afraid by the time it is a requirement to make these changes in our lives, it'll be too little too late. I also feel the same struggle of whether or not I can make all these needed changes. For example, I've decided that I want to slowly start cutting out beef from my diet, followed by cutting out pork, and then chicken, but I realized, many cultural dishes my family makes includes beef or pork or chicken and the thought of coming home and refusing to eat the dishes I grew up eating make me second guess whether or not I should change my diet. But I am well aware, it is a change that needs to be made. There are plant based alternatives I could easily substitute into the cultural dishes I love. I think the thought of making a big change in lifestyle turns people off so quickly, they don't bother to think about how bad it actually doesn't have to be.

Can't agree more. Today's technology is hitting our life in various ways, which makes each of us an influencer. We can spread the kind of influence we want. With this mindset, it's important to clarify our goal and mission. Compare to other people who don't have a clear mind of what's going on around the earth, we are truly the luckiest ones who know what's happening, and what we can do to make changes. 
 <br><br>
Even though we can't be as powerful as politicians to make national or international decisions, we are still handling our one circles. It's essential to know that it doesn't matter we are making big changes or small changes. As long as we are changing, we are saving the earth.
 <br><br>
We can start from changing our diet, buying fewer stuff, taking bus or bike to school instead of sitting inside our parents' cars...These are all changes we can make immediately. If enough people make small changes together, we are creating huge impacts.
 <br><br>
The other thing we can do instead of changing ourselves, is to inform others. We have learnt the knowledge, but others haven't. We need to use our knowledge to inform more and more people that our earth in under threat. We need to make changes, and each of us's power counts. Personally, I have talked to my roommate and parents about what I've learnt in this course, and they found what I told them interesting and mind blowing. I feel so pleased to make the positive impacts.
 <br><br>
Just like you said, we need to know our circles, and make our changes. We can all be influencers, and we can all be people who make changes.

The video “ Do we need a climate vanguard?” made some very interesting points about what we need to do to begin solving the world’s climate crisis. I believe that we definitely need those people who are willing to be the climate vanguards that will plan for what the future will be like with less pollution. I think that if we have people like that who are starting today on imaging what the problems of the future will be like we as a society will run into less problems later on. It’s sad that the majority of people actually need to be forced to begin changing their lifestyles towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way. I though that it was interesting that some countries are begging to put climate labels on food describing how bad they are for the Earth. I think this is a very good step in the right direction and people need to start thinking about more innovative ideas like this.

I agree it is sad that we can not drop our bad habits for new ones, but we must not shun and instead encourage. Yes, we are human, so change to go against what we have known will not be easy, and in fact, it will be difficult for the majority of us. But if we can recognize our shortcomings as a society and actively acknowledge them instead of ignoring them which we see happening all over, we will be better equipped to solve the issue. I agree I like the steps other countries like Denmark are taking by labeling food packaging with how much they hurt the environment. The fact that our country doesn't do this is what we should find sad. Other governments who are not in corporate pocket and obsessed with wealth are taking active steps to help protect our planet while the US, one of the planets leaders, does nothing but contribute to the issue. Most political figures in our country even hope to silence opposition to their friends and supporters in big corporations who profit from destroying our planet. I believe taking charge of our political system is the only step in the right direction and I can't wait to learn more about the political side of the climate crisis next week.
<br><hr>
I agree with Devin Cager's point of view. I also think that we are the vanguard of such environmental protection. It is not that ordinary people are not doing well enough, but now that environmental problems are too severe, we need such a group of people to remind us at all times to protect the environment. And many people in life have not really changed their way of life to do something within their power to protect the environment. Therefore, the vanguard of protecting the environment is necessary. It can promote our initiative and better protect the environment.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. In the lecture “Do we need a climate vanguard,” the “climate vanguard” refers to the people who not only participate in preventing the climate from changing but also who take the position as a leader in these kind of actions. Before when people mentioned the word “vanguard,” I usually link it to the people who are dealing with the tasks which are extremely radical and cannot be finished by a single person. However, after watching this lecture, I realize that we can become “climate vanguards” to protect our environment by simply form a habit of not wasting food and consuming more vegetables than meats. Nowadays, people are continually polluting the environment with their living styles, especially the air travel—just by flying a 24-hours flight for once, 3 metric tons of carbon dioxide will be emitted into the atmosphere by a person. However, this traveling method is almost indispensable at least for now, for both the reason which Ken mentioned in the lecture that many professors have to attend academic conference by using air travels and some international student have to study in the university by taking the flight from one country to another and so on. Thus, the method of changing our eating habits to reduce the carbon footprint becomes very crucial.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, many people right now are still not willing to change their lifestyles to protect the environment. They are only doing these when they are forced to do so. As a result, I think we the young generations should become “climate vanguards” and take the lead of protecting our Earth in the aspect of switching to a plant-based diet at least. Furthermore, we should try to convince our parents also doing this, for the fact that vegetables are healthier than meats, and the old generations’ “cultural inheritance” of meat-consuming diet is heavily influenced by the “Consumerism.”
<br><hr>
I agree to with your point of view. In the video, the professor first gives a question, do you want to take the lead and change the current situation? According to the professor, many people tend to not make this change unless they are forced to do so. Also mentioned by the professor, becoming a climate vanguard doesn’t mean it is challenging, you can start with your breakfast, make it more plants based and contains less meats in it. 
<br><br>

 Furthermore, to answer the professor’s question about whether the vanguard is necessary, I believe that having a great example can have a huge impact to people’s actions. I think not all of them have the same opportunities like us to be educated and get to know about the global warming. We need to have someone to stand up and guide the rest of us.

It’s all about making behavioral changes. And for some reason, just switching over to eating more vegetables rather than meat is too hard. I’m guilty of this, but I’m trying to do better. I believe that change starts at the individual level. Only then can we have a chance of creating real institutional change! More and more people are switching over to vegetarianism and veganism. It’s the new wave! I think it’s a great trend to hop on, no matter the reason for switching. Additionally, it’s important to shop locally and seasonally. Buying produce that is out of season is just as bad as eating chicken. All in all, we need to waste less food and switch to plant-based diets. I’m going to take this information back home with me and encourage my parents to stop eating meat. They have already stopped buying milk which I think is a great feat. When talking to them about the problem, I frame it as a health issue. They are much more responsive to that approach rather than an environmentalist one. Humans need to work together to mitigate climate change, and knowledge is key! We need to do better if not for us but at least for the sake of our children and grandchildren. If we don’t change, this planet will be largely uninhabitable for our species.

In regard to the question that Ken posed at the end of this lecture video about weather we need a climate vanguard or weather we should wait until everyone else is on board and then move together as a society to combat climate change, I think the answer is clearly we need to act now and lead the way in new developments and ideas. The reason I say this is in relation to a point made by Ken during this lecture when he shared his experience about trying to live sustainably and reduce his carbon footprint by not flying despite his career requiring him to fly to many academic conferences across the nation. Ken went on to explain how he addressed the issue and tried to utilize an online conference model for conferencing in replacement for flying many people out to a venue. He recognized that such a technology and a system would likely eventually become a reality as we are forced off of flying using fossil fuels yet it won't become a reality until people are forced to not fly. It is because of this reason that we need to act now because society as a whole will not change until we are forced to because of special interest and the powerful industries that support keeping the status quo in our society. Unrelated to the issue of flying and pushing back against the status-quo, another part of this lecture video that I found interesting was how America has Americanized other cuisines like Italian and other to contain more meat and meet the U.S. consumption that is embedded in our society. This shows me that ideas or culture that is brought into our society is quickly modified to fit into our society in a way that satisfies our unsustainable nature and constant consumption weather for products such as clothing, or need for convenient transportation, or meat products.

I 100% agree with you. I believe that individually taking action NOW fastens the time of a group of people bringing effects. It is the force and influence that lead a group of people to make changes. Ken’s personal experience of using alternatives instead of flying for conventional conferences inspires me to think about the necessity to fly from one place to another. Sometimes we think that taking the plane can be convenient and efficient, yet it has become a burden to our planet. More importantly, we have to be aware of the importance and necessity of flying. Politicians and elected officials should completely support and promote how severe to fly more than twice a year. In this case, people will eventually change their mind and be convinced by the positive effect and result of the issue.


<br><hr>
Ken’s personal experience of deciding to drop flying despite the demand of transportation as a result of his job also prompted me to think about my actions and re-evaluate whether I actually can or cannot make individual changes to my life. If I was in Ken’s position and I would honestly feel like I could not eliminate flying from my life because I would have an obligation to attend academic conferences and there is no other way to get to some of them by flying. Despite this problem, Ken showed that you can easily cut things out of your life if you put the effort into creating an alternative. The fact that Ken was able to find a way around flying gives me the strength and hope that I can make a bunch of life changes that I thought I previously could not. For example I now am becoming a climatarian, emphasize carpooling, public transportation, and biking, and am inspired to take political action outside of just voting. As for voting, I have always been strongly inclined to vote but after this course and all of Ken’s lecture videos I will now vote in the future with a better understanding of the weight of my decisions and how it my responsibility to vote on behalf of the climate.

In this lecture video, Ken asks if we want to be a part of the movement that steps out and boldly force a new culture of environmental sustainability. To me, this is not a matter of whether we want to or not. We as students of this class have access to the information we need, to be leaders of this movement. We have no excuses to just let all that we learn go in one ear and out the other. It is our responsibility as citizens of this planet to keep it alive. we have no other choice but to be the generation that stands up for a change in our traditional ways of living. We must act now before it is too late.

I admire the passion I am sensing from your comment. If our generation isn't passionate enough about this matter in order to change what has been done, then who will be? It is our duty to stand up for our home and push for leaders who understand the importance of making serious change. We as the students of this class are extremely fortunate to be receiving the knowledge we need to be fully aware, and to take appropriate action towards this timed disaster. It will be too late to try to reverse any damage done to our earth before we know it, and there won't be anything we can do about it. We will have failed the planet and all future generations. How can the current population be so selfish to not feel the need to keep this planet inhabitable for many generations to come? Even though we won't be here, that doesn't mean others can't either. We have a job and time is running out.

In the lecture, Ken talks about the carbon tax that if the government does impose the carbon tax, people will be forced to protect the planet that they cannot afford the price to make carbon emissions. However, people have the ability to do much more than just waiting for the government to make legislations about improving the environment. We all make a lot of personal decisions everyday, and many of them are related to our environment. For example, when we want to take the uber from school to the restaurant, we can first check on the google map to see whether we can take the bus. If everyone would like to make small changes like that, we can make a very big difference.

In response to Ken's questions, I believe that there is no time to wait for others to realize the reality of the climate crisis; it's better to act now and set the precedent, so that (hopefully) other generations will catch up in the future. 
<br><br>
I really liked a particular argument that Ken brought up. He mentioned that for many Americans, it will be later rather than sooner that they will change their lifestyles for the environment. However, he states that this is actually beneficial because it gives us time and a number of years to experiment and come up with ways to promote environmental sustainability, and I agree with that. Once the rest of America starts to join the fight against the climate crisis, hopefully there will be already a number of viable options and alternatives available. 
<br><br>
Ken mentions a few suggestions on what we can do personally to help mitigate the crisis: be politically active, fly less, and reduce food waste/change to a plant-based diet. 
<br><br>
I agree that it's important to be politically active, especially with elections coming up soon; it's essential that all voters are aware of who they are voting for, and what will their politician do to fight for the environment. For example, Ken mentions how we need to elect politicians that will put on carbon taxes, which will directly tax fossil fuel suppliers and price carbon.
<br><br>
The second one is personally a lot harder. Airplane transportation has always been an extremely convenient method for many Americans, especially if it is for travel or work. Even if people started to fly less when traveling, flying less for work/business trips would be quite difficult, especially with the time restrictions. 
<br><br>
The third one is also a personally difficult decision for myself. As Ken mentions, the culture in which we are born into influences what we eat. I was born into a family and a culture that consumes a lot of meat-based foods, but I was always taught to never have leftovers after I finish eating. Even though I am aware that a plant-based diet would be overall more beneficial (not in all cases though), it personally would be a difficult change.

I agree with you. There really isn't any time to waste right now. If we were to wait for others to be "on board" with it, then it will probably take forever for the whole world to come around. By that time, it will be too late. I think the sooner ew implement these laws and regulations, people will have no choice but to be on board with it. The sooner we start, the easier it will be for Americans to adjust from their current lifestyle to a more environmentally friendly one. It was interesting to see in Ken's video that he acknowledges the cultural background behind people eating meat. I have always heard that we need to have a plant based diet in order to save the planet, but nobody ever acknowledges how hard it will be to switch to such a diet when your cultural background makes up of so much of who you are and what you eat. Although it may be hard to modify cultural traditions to be more environmentally friendly, it has got to be done, Therefore, if we act now, people will have time to adjust to a new lifestyle before the whole world collapses.


<br><hr>
Definitely; I think that it is honestly unfortunate that many people will take a long time to finally realize that the crisis must be mitigated as soon as possible, but I agree that once we implement these regulations to be sustainable, people will be forced to follow them. Although, I still find it disappointing that we need to force people to be sustainable...especially when we're all living in the same planet. It seems unfair that the majority of people aren't actually aware that our home is dying, and people that are actually fighting the crisis have to pick up the slack. 
<br><br>
I also agree about your point of Ken's argument regarding meat. Even for myself, I was always taught that switching to a plant-based diet is beneficial for the environment, through this class and at home. However, it is really difficult to switch, and it is easier said than done.

I would say we do. But the social status and aggressiveness of this vanguard can largely influence the effectiveness of the idea and behavior he’s in favor of.
<br><br>

First of all, living an environmentally healthy life is essentially a cultural thing. That’s why a leader with a respected identity is needed in propelling such action. My mother’s nun came from a poor rural village in  china. The family she’s born into couldn’t afford to buy any animal product, thus she grew up, unintentionally, being a vegan. However when she entered a more developed area later in her life, she couldn’t switch into a normal diet anymore, she would vomit everything in her stomach if the soup she tasted contained a drop of butter. In this case, we can see how much impact the environment one grew up in has on his later behavior. Has she ever heard about the impact of a plant-based diet on the environment? Perhaps never. But she did that anyway because it’s the way she was raised, it is her culture. However, hardly anyone admired her behavior so much that they want to live her lifestyle. Which comes to my argument that such a role, a climate vanguard must be conducted with someone with an important social status. It can be the government, a celebrity or the core member in a sports club.
<br><br>

Secondly, the extent to which he or she suggests changes made in people’s behavior should also be considered. If too radical, most would subconsciously reject his proposal. Unless the proposal was made by a government that has absolute power over everything that it doesn’t care about the public opinion. In this case, certain radical acts like carbon taxes can be established uccessfully.

I like this video a lot because Ken doesn’t hold any punches in regards to holding people accountable, especially those of us enrolled in the class.  As he said, most Americans probably will not make the necessary changes required to combat the growing crisis. I know that most people, even after being in this class for six weeks, will continue to live their lives unaffected by the information they learned in the class. At least, not until the CC directly affects us, and we can no longer live like it doesn’t exist. So many populations around the world are already suffering the effects of our dying planet, but many people in America continue to live free of these debilitating floods, fires, and destruction of land that most of the population suffers through. If people aren’t even willing to eat a burger or two less than they usually do, they certainly won’t make the necessary changes to eliminate emissions from cars and planes. 
<br><br>

Even the idea of voting for candidates in favor or legislation like the Green New Deal is one that many people simply don’t take into consideration when casting their ballot, when it is clearly THE most pressing issue of our generation. It is scary to sit in a class where everyone who isn’t talking over the professor is taking in the information needed to save our planet and yet still not actively making those changes in their lives. I know that my carbon footprint probably isn’t zero either, but I have made it a point to work towards implementing the climate saving suggestions in this class that I haven’t already been doing. But a few people making that change won’t have the same impact as if all 700+ people in this course actually followed these guidelines for a greener lifestyle.

According to a simple web search, a vanguard is someone who is the forefront of new ideas or inventions. Greta Thunberg is an example of this, as Ken explained in his video. She stunned the world by becoming the face of activism for climate change at such a young age. I believe we do need people to lead this revolution who have the power to sway America to change almost every single one of our habits and completely reshape the economy. But this will be extremely difficult. Our endless consumerism shapes our economy that was made for endless economic growth, at the sacrifice of our environment. 
<br><br>
 Change will only be made if every single person, and our future generation changes our ways. This involves becoming vegetarian, never taking a plane flight again, and completely stopping the use of cars. I believe this will never happen because each person’s impact is so miniscule nobody thinks them alone is making a difference. Every single person would have to do it, and publicize it. This will probably never happen, and we will probably make tiny changes to our lifestyle, if even that. We’re screwed.

What really caught my attention in this lecture was the mention of how a range of cuisines have been ‘Americanized’ by adding meat to the food. This was so upsetting because literally the meat industry has become so wide in America that foods from different regions are being changed just to fit meat into the cuisine. The other interesting point Ken made was the fact that we need to elect officials who will support the tax on carbon. From there the cost of fossil fuel using products will increase. The plane example was really great because people right now the prices of plane tickets are reasonable at times. But, if they were to be increased a lot due to the carbon tax there would be less people wanting to travel. Same would go for gasoline, it would be more convenient for people to use public transportation if prices are literally like 3x what it is now.
<br><br>
The plant based diet idea more people have to get on board with. I do believe it would be easier than thought to be and it will of course benefit in the long run against the meat industry emissions. However, like mentioned by Ken, waiting for everyone's to get on board would not work out. The government especially will not get on board due to the fact that these damaging industries; meat, dairy, and fossil fuel are coming to them and acting like they aren't the bad guys. They help fund their campaigns and in turn politicians have to say what they want them to say as well as keep quiet about what they are doing to the environment in reality. For these industries it would be terrible, but starting by trying to get people to switch might be easier. I remember watching a commercial about the plant based burger and the regular, and people could not tell which was which. This is an example that tells us that plant-based diets aren’t so bad, people might be able to do them, we just assume that plants = no flavor.

You bring an interesting point about the plant-based diet mimicking the food we consume right now and how we cannot tell a difference from which is which. I have heard a lot on the news and YouTube videos about the impossible burger and what I hear most people say is that it's delicious and resembles the texture of a beef patty. But of course, those kinds of meals are not cheap but there are potential in the food market to buy vegan options to eat that come at a reasonable price. This is a step towards the right direction of helping people realize that they don't need for meat in order to satisfy their need for meat, there are alternative options that are healthier to the body as well as the environment.


<br><hr>
I agree with the points that you made throughout your comment. I was unaware that originally Italian food didn't have meat included, however when those recipes came to the United States they all were altered to include meat because at that time if you had meat to eat it meant that you were well off and it was a symbol of status. However, that is not the case anymore so when our generation wants to switch to a plant based diet it should not be seen as disrespectful since those meals didn't originally include meat. While I had originally thought that taking meat out of our diet and switching to a plant-based diet would be enough alone and would significantly reduce our carbon footprint, it turns out that certain vegetables have the same carbon emissions as beef. Vegetables can have a large carbon emission if they are flown in from a different country because planes are the fastest way to release the most carbon at once. Taking this into consideration not only do we need to switch to a plant-based diet, but we also have to know that those vegetables are local so their transportation doesn't release a great deal of carbon into the atmosphere.
<br><hr>
I agree with Yvette's comment. It may seem that we are helpless in the face of climate change but this frame of mind cannot be further from the truth. We will not make the changes necessary unless we are required to do so, I believe this statement is really profound because it’s true. It is very important to elect politicians that will implement the strict laws that will steer us in the right direction. We no longer have the time to debate or consider safer strategies, we need to act now. When Professor Hiltner asked us, “Do you want to take the lead?” I remembered that all of these changes cannot come to fruition without people like us. People from younger generations with voting power that have enough education to make wise decisions and energy to see that these changes are played out in the adequate manner we desire. Food is always a cultural and personal ritual. This is why it is difficult to switch to a largely plant-based diet. Beef is almost always seen as a necessary American staple, a must whenever one eats out. Personally, an expensive cut of steak and glass of wine was the epitome of luxury and affluence. Now I am glad I have never bought a piece of steak and after attending English 23 I am proud to say I never will. We are so often persuaded by the media that flying first class, eating meat and driving multiple cars is not just the American Dream but an American constitutional right, “pursuit of happiness.” Although these luxuries might make us happy and leave us with fond memories it truly isn’t contentment. I believe contentment shouldn’t be material or consumerism based. My family consumes a lot of meat and whenever we celebrate a joyous occasion we always have a “carne asada”, a cookout. A lot of happy childhood memories were built on these small family gatherings but when I asked my mom if she had carne asadas back in Mexico she said no. Her own happy childhood memories consisted of refried beans, nopales and salsa from the molcajete. Her simple yet nutritious and delicious diet built my mother’s family strong and healthy. It was only until they arrived in the US that they traded the molcajete for 15 pounds of beef, sausages and chicken that is now a staple in the family table. I have introduced my parents to these videos and tried educating them and I am happy to say that they agree wholeheartedly to the Mediterranean Diet. My mom is a health freak and my dad is a picky eater and often suffers from stomach pains so this would fit them like a glove. I cannot say the same for the rest of my family but I am content with converting my own parents and sister. All in all I think we can make the personal decision to stop flying, eat less or no meat and buy less cheap clothing. We are the change we wish to see in the world and it truly does start with us.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, and I believe there will be more and more vegetarians in the future. Twenty years ago, people were thinking about how to eat their fill, so people eat everything. Now, some people have started thinking about how to eat healthily instead of eating the best food. With the awareness of environmental issues and body health, I think vegetarianism will become more and more accepted by the general public. From an environmental perspective, Ken has told us how much carbon is produced by beef. From a health perspective, science has shown that high fat, sugar, and other foods are harmful to the human body. This is even more evident in the American diet. Therefore, better eating habits for the environment and the body will emerge in the future.

<br><hr>
I agree with you in part. The meat industry in the United States is very developed now. Those meats not only occupy the American market, but also have American-made meats all over the world. Compared to vegetables, meat is more popular worldwide. Many workers make money from animal husbandry. I think carbon tax can really reduce carbon emissions very effectively. Because of higher costs, businesses are more willing to produce products with lower carbon emissions. Because of rising commodity prices, people can only buy fewer goods. And businesses will be more willing to develop new energy-saving technologies. But is this really the case? Many times people's pure approach does not make things better. The world is complex and diverse, and the world is not limited to the United States. For example, if the cost of meat production in the United States has increased, US meat manufacturers have become less competitive worldwide. US meat exports will decrease and meat imports will increase. The economic level of the United States will be hit. The reduction of meat produced in the United States does not reduce the world's carbon emissions. Because the world's demand for meat has always been huge. If the United States does not produce, there will be other countries producing meat, and the American meat industry will also move factories outside the country. Unless all countries can agree to a unified carbon tax, it will only reduce the competitiveness of the United States.

I think a climate vanguard would be very much needed, but I'm afraid of how effective it would truly be. A climate vanguard would be able to convince people to help fight the effects of climate change in a much more personal and compelling manner, and oftentimes appealing to a person's sense of pathos is much greater than anything else. However, humans, and particularly Americans, are stubborn. People like retaining lifestyles that are comfortable and familiar to them. They don't like feeling that they have to sacrifice their creature comforts for something that doesn't seem to be outright affecting them. Sometimes a person's argument, no matter how compelling or riddled with facts and statistics it is, will fall on deaf ears because people simply just aren't always willing to change their ways for a greater good. 
<br><br>

Though my above sentiment is definitely much more pessimistic, I believe that if any generation would be able to break this cycle, it is the current one. Younger generations are definitely much more sensitive and aware of the bigger pictures at play, whereas I feel older generations don't really connect to the bigger picture in the equation. Younger generations can inspire and drive each other to be more aware of what happens on and to our earth, and hopefully we all end up being a climate vanguard to someone else.

I believe that the concept of a carbon tax is a great and necessary first step in the reduction of GHG emissions. Fossil fuel companies not only are destroying the planet in terms of their physical products, but they are also actively trying to persuade the general public that the climate crisis is not an issue and that there is no need to take any action. Because of this, pushing these corporations out of power will directly reduce carbon emissions, as well as will help the public see clearly about the severity of climate change and push them to start taking steps to solve the problem (such as electing officials who make it a priority to push other environmentally conscious agendas such as the solutions listed out in Project Drawdown).
 
<br><br>



On another note, I was surprised to hear that many cuisines were revised to include meat (mostly beef) when they were imported in America as a display of wealth. At this point, I am not at all surprised that the beef industry took advantage of this fact and ingrained eating beef as a part of the American lifestyle. Once again, it is shocking to see how corporations manipulate consumerism and create a demand for a product that is not only detrimental to the environment but also detrimental to our physical health. I agree with Ken in that we need a huge cultural shift in the way that we view the traditional American lifestyle and food and that we need to write our massive national consumption of beef out of this new lifestyle. But, as with many of the other issues in this class, this cannot be done without fighting the major industry (food and beef) that is responsible for the current lifestyle.

Am I an architect of the future? This indeed is a challenging question to answer. As much as I would love to say yes I believe it very difficult for anyone to turn their daily lifestyle completely over to a minimalist lifestyle. We would have to change many aspects of our life for instance our daily diet, the things we own, what we wear, the way we travel, ect. In addition, we will not be able to make this change by ourselves, we would need the help of many people including politicians to pass policies that help support environmentalists. If policies are not formed we will have a very hard time adjusting to a new lifestyle because our life right now is not coherent with the minimalistic lifestyle. Technology is too advanced, we have easy access to online shopping that makes us want to buy more. Uber eats, postmates and many others are advancing resources that make our lives easier but are not contributing to a healthier environment. These resources in the end are making us lazier and with such an easy resource on hand for many people nowadays, it makes it really hard to completely stop using this technology unless everyone stops or it no longer exists. On the other hand, bike lanes and separate roads for public transportation need to advance all over the world in order for people to start using them more and it should also be more affordable to ride the bus or buy a bike. However this will not be effective unless some source of power from the government is in support of changing major forms of lifestyle to protect our earth. This should happen soon and in the meantime I believe we should all start helping reduce greenhouse gases as of now!

As Ken noted before, the burden of restoring the environment has fallen onto our generation and the future generations years to come. The leaders of world however are still people from the last century—the generation Ken belongs to. The vanguard of the previous generations has pushed for positive changes such as rapid advancement in economy and technology, and also negative byproducts like climate change. I believe that we need a vanguard as well for this generation, a collective group who can respond to the need of this generation and the many future generations to come, setting an example, pushing for a change, etc.
  <br><br>
 Therefore I think a vanguard is necessary, and critical after seeing many current organizations have failed to convey the seriousness of climate change to varying degree. But it will still be fruitless without our individual effort. I see a vanguard as a representation of this generation (not a political stance), and we as a part of this generation needs to know what is correct and what is not correct. If each individual fails to do what is correct, the vanguard will not be able to progress in a way we hope it will, and it will instead follow what the vanguard of the previous generations did.

Recently, there are some news that are really worrying. For example, a few days ago, the United States released the largest fireworks in the world, which are weighed 1.27 tons. Needless to say, this action caused many carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. Because of recreation, people released too much greenhouse gases. Also, it is normal for most of us to travel by air during the vacation. These air trips emit carbon dioxide directly to the atmosphere as well. Another news also caused by climate crisis is the wildfires in Australia. The fire was finally extinguished by the rainfall. But, after that, the flooding come exactly behind the fire. Even though nowadays there are still a lot of people who do not believe the existence of climate crisis, bad things happened more frequently.
  <br><br>
As for me, I will try my best to reduce air traveling. If I need to travel by the air, I will take non-stop flights. Besides, I will walk and use public transportation to school every day. Also, I will try to consume less meat and waste less food. We should act from now on, even with some small actions at first. But, as long as everybody joins in, we will make a big difference altogether. We are not only doing for ourselves, but also for our future generations. We can not let the Earth be destroyed in our hands.

I found the Denmark comment very interesting since being able to see the climate footprint of all of our food would be useful, helpful, and simply nice. As Ken discussed in the video, not everything is as green and eco-friendly as we think it is. For example, Ken brings up asparagus and how if we were to eat it during its offseason, it could have a larger carbon footprint than beef due to the air travel used to get it to you. We often assume that just cutting out meat is going to solve so many problems but it can lead us down a different path of large amounts of carbon emission if we are not careful enough. I would love if this idea that came from Denmark were to happen because I feel like it would help the people who are trying to be more eco-friendly to easily find foods to help reduce their footprints but also it allows for other people to see just how bad some of the things they are eating are in the CO2 area. The whole thing with becoming “green” is the education we get about what it means to be green. Even the education we get, may not be eco-friendly because the lecturer traveled on a plane to tell us about how to be green or maybe we are told that just our daily changes alone can make a large difference. I feel as though we need better education on these topics so that we can make better choices in our lifestyles and the people that we elected into government positions. Only then is when we can become more eco-friendly and lessen our carbon footprint to maybe the point where other countries, such as Denmark or Sweden, are at right now.

I also found Denmark’s strive towards becoming a completely carbon-neutral country very admirable. This is why I love Scandinavian countries; their countries value environmental sustainability, nation-wide healthcare, and accessible education, to name a few things. We should not wait until everyone is on-board to make sweeping climate action, especially when there are already other countries who are setting great examples of ways to become more carbon-neutral. It’s unfortunate that being environmentally friendly is so complex, that simply eating greens instead of meat can actually be unhelpful. Not everyone has the time and motivation to educate themselves on all aspects of a sustainable diet, recycling practices, effects of different modes of transportation, etc. Vocabulary like “lacto-ovo vegetarian diet…,” what is that? Fancy terms like that can be intimidating and discouraging for some to join in on a sustainable movement because it makes it seem like a huge commitment to become well versed on different diets and their effects. Denmark’s implementation of climate labels on their food products is an example of a way to make the carbon-footprint of produce more transparent with the average citizen. In other words, it makes it easier for the average citizen to make easy changes like buying products that cost less carbon. I think these sorts of system changes that make it easier on the average citizen to not have to do all the research on what kind of produce is best to buy in which season will get more people on board. What would be amazing is for Ken to share a website that consolidates this type of helpful information if such a site exists.

The same U.S. that voted for Trump is the same U.S. that will not make a transition to something as amazing as Denmark. I think that we need to start with cities and ease in; it is plausible to have cities like Ventura, Santa Barbara, Portland to build better bike lanes and public transit… essentially cities where people are relatively active and cities that are or lean towards the liberal side of the political spectrum. I completely agree with you on the points you made about the benefits of Denmark. But, as Ken states, most Americans will not make the necessary changes until forced, and something like putting carbon labels on foods seems before America’s time. One point I never actually thought about was that there is an irony in eating so-called Italian food in America. We have redefined what is Italian food by adding meat to pizza. 

  <br><br>

You don’t have to be a Greta to make a change, an individual person has a lot of influence as well. If you adopt eco-friendly ways and spread the word on less food waste, try to eat what is local if possible, etc. to your friends, family, and even your social media (AND ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH), you can have a lot of power to change people’s detrimental  habits. For example, we have the personal decision to not fly or even not fly as much. We can be creative with our traveling if we want to travel. We can suggest and adopt using conference models to attend conferences without the major carbon footprint. 

  <br><br>

So yes, I agree with Ken. We cannot wait until we are even more desperate. I think using Sweden and Denmark as a goal and making it into our reality will take some major work, but I think it would be amazing if we could do so. As you mentioned, education is key! Starting from the young kids through high school while also taking part in intergenerational education. Preventative care is important in medicine. So let’s become doctors and practice preventative care on our earth.

One of the main points of this video was that climate conscious changes are readily available and in our own hands. Given that we are all college-aged students in control of our own diets, the choice to eat a more plant-based diet and not waste as much food is readily available to us. It’s not an action that we need a politician for, nor one that requires an excessive amount of effort. It was pretty inspiring and motivational to hear how capable we are of making effective change just by changing a selfish action. Like Ken said, we are living in the future now. In the past few years I can even clearly see this as so many new dairy-alternatives have entered the market, and as meat substitutes like the beyond burger become popular. 
    <br><br>
  In response to Ken’s question, I do think that change  needs to come from a personal standpoint, not from waiting for the rest of the world to change. Waiting to change when others finally do is like waiting for your homework to do itself - it’s just never gonna happen. Denmark is a great example of this. Unlike waiting for the “world leader” United States to make an environmental change and then follow it- they’re blazing the trail instead. I am so impressed with the idea of including the environmental impact of food items on their labels, just like a nutritional label is included. Denmark earns my respect for this. I hope that maybe the U.S. can learn from them and have some changes like this too.

Why wait? I feel like we should not be beating around the bush and just start now. I have recently gone vegan last week (I had been vegetarian for a little more than a year prior) and though it has been a bit difficult finding food to eat since I have a meal swipe plan, I am going to do what I can to prepare my own cooked meals. I had been thinking about going vegan for a while now, not only because it would be beneficial for the climate and ethical reasons, but for my health. As Ken mentioned, switching to a mostly plant-based diet is healthier compared to eating meat. Over the break, I watched a film with my mom called The Game Changers, which is available on Netflix where the premise is about how not eating meat is healthier for yourself. According to the film, humans were born to eat plants as they use evidence of the way our teeth are formed (the way it is shaped gives us the ability to chew food such as plants) and our ability to see color allows us to differentiate between fruit and vegetables. My mom even reduced her meat consumption for a couple of days because she was moved by the documentary and felt better. Not just health-wise, but also about herself because she was able to do it. As Ken also mentioned, people in the United States did not consume as much meat as we do today, which was due to a cultural shift from ads that emphasized eating meat. I cannot remember exactly from the film, but eating meat was a way of showing a man’s “masculinity.” If any of you guys get the chance, I highly recommend watching the film because it has definitely made me reconsider how I eat.

By going vegan, I will influence my friends and family to go vegan, vegetarian, or at least consume less meat because they have a person in their life where they can see and say, “People actually can switch to a different diet.” Two of my friends were vegan and vegetarian and it influenced me in some fashion to switch my diet. However, I must also give credit to Ken’s ENGL 22: Literature and the Environment course because that was also a major influence on my decision. My family was surprised when I told them I was vegetarian and somewhat did not believe that I was actually going to go vegan. If you’re not vegetarian or vegan yourself, you could possibly be the first person in your family or friend group to do it.

We can waste less food by obviously trying to eat what you can take and using every part of the food but perhaps through the practice of composting. I do not know much about composting and do not know how effective they are, but it would definitely be a better solution than just dumping it in the trash. I hardly see compost bins anywhere: there are none at restaurants, none at the residence halls, and other places. Through voting politicians into office that cares about these issues, we can mitigate this predicament. I also want to admire that although Ken is a professor and with this requires going to academic conferences, he has decided to not take airplanes and is working on other means such as Skype calls to attend conferences to reduce his carbon footprint. Though it may not be easy for everyone, we need to at least try to reduce our carbon footprint in any way we can. We have to do something though, climate change is here and it is only bound to get worse if we do not act quickly.

I agree- I feel like a lot of the practices  we discussed are pretty accessible to pick up. While veganism/vegetarianism may be bigger step than others, it's not as difficult as stopping flying or driving. I became vegetarian this year and it's honestly a lot less difficult than I worried it would be, and it was really quick to integrate into my lifestyle. I think the cultural aspect of meat/food is something we need to be more understanding of, but I do think switching to a meatless/vegan/ or very low meat-consumptive diet is a big step in the right direction- it may just take people time to accept it/get used to it. Also, your note on changing how we waste food by only getting what we know we'll use is a really good point- that is a really easy way to help the earth. By rethinking what and how much of a product they buy, decreasing their meat intake, and finding out ways to utilize all parts of the food products they use, as Ken noted, we can make a major impact.  Along this note- I think the idea of putting climate labels on our food is a really interesting idea- we could see the carbon footprint of what we are eating/buying and maybe limit what we buy from there, but I also think it may only impact a specific type of person- only some people actually look at the nutrition facts on the food they buy, so I doubt all people will look at the climate facts on the food they buy. However, I do think innovation along those lines is a really good step in the right direction.

I applaud you for taking the initiative to switch to go vegan and completely support how you mentioned that by going vegan yourself, you will influence others to do so as well and realize the impact of what you are doing. Over the course of this class, I have subtle been attempting to adjust my own diet by eating much more vegetables to get used to it being the main bulk of my meal at the dining commons; however, because this is the first time I am trying to somewhat maintain a plant-based diet, I find it extremely difficult to remove meat from my diet. One of things that I keep telling myself is that it is too difficult and asking myself what impact will it really have if not everyone does it? However, if we don’t do it then how can we expect others to make the change. If we want a better future for the earth and the coming generations than we must set forward the expectations we hold through a change of culture and lifestyle that must be seen as positive and absolutely necessary rather than a change of freedom.
    <br><br>

Ken has brought up an important question that we must ask ourselves about being the climate vanguards. By taking the initiative to remove our desire to travel by plane and changing our diets, hopefully others can catch on and recognize its significance. But this must be done effectively through peer-to-peer and cross-generational communication for everyone to understand the impact it will have rather than only a very small percentage taking such an initiative. These solutions have brought light on very doable applications I can implement into my own life such as taking mass transit and putting my vote to use. Ever since I came here, I have biked more than I have ever, increased the number of greens in my diet, registered to vote, and have broadened my perspective on the impact of my own climate footprint. So to respond to his question, I believe I am ready to place myself among a movement of change.

Of everything that we have learned in this class thus far, switching to a largely plant based diet and wasting less food seems to be the easiest, quickest, and most accessible way that we, as college students, can help to slow down climate change. Theoretically, if everyone in the world stopped eating meat products, we could reduce climate change hugely. However, this is clearly not going to happen right now. When Ken asks if we need a climate vanguard to jump start our journey in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, I would say that there does not necessarily need to be one person telling everyone what to do. You can be your own climate vanguard; hold yourself accountable, and encourage the people around you to do the same.
    <br><br>

Something I found interesting in Ken’s lecture video was the idea of not wasting a single food scrap, and his discussion about pickled watermelon rinds being a Southern delicacy. The first thing that I thought was “why don’t you just compost all of that?” I have grown up composting, and try to compost any extra food scraps that I can. Understandably, not all food can be composted, and not all food scraps can be eaten (whether that be for safety, or for just pure dislike in the taste). Regardless, composing is a great step in beginning to waste less food on a daily basis. Compositing can also encourage you to eat more of a plant based diet because you will be able to compost your food scraps. Even though composting seems like it would have a teeny tiny impact on our Earth, it is better to compost the food scraps that you can, rather than add to a huge issue and make it even bigger.

"You can be your own climate vanguard; hold yourself accountable, and encourage the people around you to do the same." Really what it means to be a leader. When you know something is the right thing to do there is no good reason to wait around for somebody else to lead the movement when you have the ability to do so. I really enjoyed reading your comment because your two main points from this lecture video were my two main as well. As students we keep asking Ken for guidance for things we can do to help mitigate the climate crisis, and switching to a primarily plant based diet is definitely one of them. For students who are busy, limited, and on a budget this change would not cause them to compromise their time or their money. Plus by doing a great thing for the planet you'd think this transition would be easily favored.  

    <br><br>

When Ken was talking about not wasting food in this video, the first thing that came to my mind was also composting which is why your comment stood out to me the most! My mom has always been really big on not wasting any food. She hates the thought of throwing out food and even if there are only a few bites left she will save it for another day. If we do throw out food though once it has gone bad we have always composted it. I would be curious to see the journey the compost bin makes once it leaves the house and whether it is actually serving the purpose of good or not.


<br><hr>
 I enjoyed your insight about budget not being an issue for students to change to a plant based diet. I understand that some supermarkets, such as Sprouts or Whole Foods, may offer organic and ‘healthier’ options for a large price. However, shopping locally at farmers markets is not as expensive as many people might think. I go to the Goleta farmers market almost every Sunday at the Camino Real Marketplace and have found that their fresh produce is not much more expensive than in a regular grocery store. As a bonus, it is local, organic, and fresh, so I know I am always getting the best I can. Also, if someone was really looking to save money on greens, they could plant their own vegetable garden. Growing up, my parents had a fruit and vegetable garden and the freshness of these items always made any meal taste better. They also keep giving as long as you take good care of them! So yes, I do agree with Sophie that it is not too hard to find good solid produce and switch to a healthier, more sustainable diet.

I do believe we need a climate vanguard. Waiting for everyone else to be on board with a vegan diet, and one that wastes less food, will not come quick enough. This change needs to happen soon.

I was surprised to find that eating asparagus in the winter is just as harmful as eating chicken, due to the fact that asparagus has to be flown in. I wish there was more accessible information on how to truly have a healthy, eco-friendly diet. A lot of the time people, including myself, assume that just because something is labeled “vegan” that automatically means it’s healthy. When this is far from the case. I could eat oreos, a bag of chips, and some vegan popcorn and be far from a healthy diet. I know a lot of vegans do eat healthier diets than vegetarians or carnivores, but it was interesting to find out that a food perceived as so healthy can be just as harmful.

One of the solutions that the professor mentions is a "carbon tax", which is a tax on any actions or items that involve the usage of carbon. With time, the price of this tax will increase. I think that this carbon tax has 2 major benefits: 1) One of the biggest reasons why many legislators (and people with power) do not "believe" in the concept of climate change is because they have many financial interests in fossil fuel related companies. In other words, these people make a lot of money from companies that are dependent on fossil fuels and with the movements to curb climate change, many of these companies struggle. By placing a carbon tax, many of these companies would have to pay a lot more extra to continue doing these harmful practices. As a result, either they will stop, or they will become too expensive and as a result of a trickle down effect, many of the people in power may soon realize that have interest in these types of companies may not be worth it. 2) Another reason why the carbon tax may be beneficial is because many commonplace, environmentally unfriendly action may become much more expensive and may price out many of its consumer. For example, an example the professor gives is flying. By placing a carbon tax, flying will become much more expensive and thus many people may be demotivated to participate in this fossil fuel guzzling action.

I definitely agree with you and the idea of imposing a carbon tax to hopefully reduce the reliance and usage of carbon. The benefits you listed would make a big change in how the fossil fuel industries operate and how consumers buy. I like the idea of the carbon tax because it puts the problem at hand, the climate crisis, in the faces of everyone. Especially those like us who live in America and other developed countries that may not necessarily be feeling the real consequences of the climate crisis. The carbon tax would provide a way for people to check their own emissions as it would be reflected in their day to day lives. Yes, people will decide to no longer fly as the prices sky rocket and become more conscious and aware of their carbon footprint. The goal would be for all of us to maintain this level of consciousness as we go about other aspects of our lives, not just in respect to something we will miss such as flying. Rethinking where to shop, what companies to support, and should you even be shopping. Deeper research when it comes time to vote locally and nationally, and reconsidering whether or not that hamburger is worth it. We all need to do our part in mitigating the climate crisis, and I think the carbon tax would force these kinds of changes to happen.

I used to believe that making personal changes in my life were really not that important because on a grand scale, my changes would be insignificant. However, like Ken phrased it at the end, do we act now or do we wait for the rest of the world to be on board? I now know that I am not the only person who would be making a change, because many individuals are not trying to change their lifestyles in order to help the environment. If I make a change, I can encourage my family and those around me to start making changes to. This is the only way to improve the world around us, while we wait for everyone else to understand the climate crisis. As I wait to go back home after graduating from UCSB, I am already thinking about how to ensure that my family is being more conscious about their lifestyle. Now that I have all this knowledge and I am making changes I need to go back to an environment that resembles the one I am creating for myself. I am hoping that through showing them some of the films we have watched or trying to teach them in other ways I can encourage them to make the change even if the rest of the world is not yet on board.

The future of our planet and our health depend on our ability to heavily cut down on our input to climate change.  There are many simple solutions to this problem yet people don't understand what it takes to make that change. Hopeful improvements include limiting air travel, switching to a vegetarian diet, and the production of sustainable products. We say that we need to "act now" or to "act fast", but some people cannot accept that change and live that way. And that's the critical part. It takes one to inspire another and it takes another to inspire the world. That is the nature of humans and it is time to spark a change for yourself and the world around you before it is too late. We can become the so called climate vanguards and inspire other generations to follow our generation.

This week’s lecture is about how food is affecting the climate. And the idea of veganism is spreading around the world, more and more people put in actions. But actually, the vegan diet isn’t that productive. There are a lot of food transportations around the world, if we can just eat local foods, this can reduce a lot of emissions due to transportation. And we should eat more vegetables rather than meat or dairy products. To answer Ken’s question, I think it is time to start now, we don’t have time to waste. I liked Ken’s idea about a carbon tax, I think this would definitely help. And I also agree with the idea that people around you, especially your family affect your diet. That in other way means that you can also be the one who affect others diet, we should promote a healthy plant-based diet to our family and friends, start with yourself, and make a difference.

“Are you an architect of the future?” Professor Hiltner asks, and it’s an interesting question. For many of us, our lives are just beginning – we’re between 18 and 22 and have our whole lives ahead of us. So why is it so hard to visualize a life beyond our now? People throw so much of their food away, and what a lot of us don’t seem to realize is that it has impacts beyond just what is on our plates in front of us. Human beings are inherently wasteful, and the fact that we were causing a lot of this waste wasn’t known until most of us reached college, as was the case with myself. Professor Hiltner asks if we want to be architects of the future – I don’t really think we have a choice.

I agree. Either we are architects of the future, or future refugees. One of these two sounds way more appealing. Changing the way we live and the way others live will not be easy. We are at the point that deniers and the ignorant do not have time to voluntarily change. Either we enact laws to force this change or we all suffer the consequences.

In a way, I see the upcoming change as a junkie going through withdrawal. We will, even with change, face climate wars, riots and chaos, but also survival.

A great deal of this class concerns conversation regarding politics and culture. While this may seem odd, considering this class is a climate crisis class not a poly-sci or sociology course. The reason this is important is because, especially in the western world, bad environmental economics has deep cultural roots. Weather it be cars, meat, or flying, Americans see environmentally damaging commodities as essential to our way of life. Additionally, our political mantra in the United states centers on freedom, however, the particular kind of freedom we value is not frequently specified. Americans prefer freedom to over freedom from (handmaids tale). Essentially, we prefer our legislation allows us the opportunity to be free to drive a car rather than the opportunity to be free of environmentally pollution such as the staggeringly poor air quality in major cities. While this can, at times, be an advantageous preference, it hinders us most when it comes to climate crisis legislation. People are very unwilling to accept ideas such as a carbon tax because, on paper, it seems as though it is a direct assault on our freedom to drive a car or travel in a plane. Thus, the conflict over how best to address the climate crisis from a political standpoint is very difficult. This plays back into the conversation about "Merchants of Doubt" and "Why Scientist Disagree about Climate Change;" if there is even a shadow of a doubt that anthropocentric climate change may not be real, then climate change legislation is evil and corrupt in the mind of the american voter. This conundrum is not one which is easily approached, but it begins with small personal changes and excising ones voice. As ken stated in his video, if we begin to make these changes in the absence of legislation mandating our actions, we will be ahead of the american people in general. It is important to realize that one person making a change is not just one person. Your actions may not have any influence over the political state of climate change, however, it can affect how we culturally view this issue. Many people mentioned receiving criticism for the changes they made  in their diets, while this is unfortunate it does point out that the changes we make as individuals do not go unnoticed. The way I see it, these are the only two avenues in our fight to mitigate climate change: cultural changes we choose to make and political legislation which forces us to behave a certain way. If we improve our cultural outlook on this particular issue of climate change, this will help to make legislation regarding climate change less necessary and thus, allow for a smoother transition overall. We must change our american way of life if we are to change the planet, doing so in your personal life can help to minimize the political infringements which are sure to come if we have any hope of saving the planet.

I think most people struggle with making the jump to a fully vegan diet. A lot of Americans feel like its impossible to give up eating meat, because most of their diet is centered around a piece of meat. I think what would be the most beneficial is educating others on new recipes and diets that are both tastes good and is vegan. Another option I can think of is that the carbon taxing the meat and dairy products that are sold.

Growing up, I was raised in the "typical" mexican-american diet, where there was always rice and beans to eat, as well as fresh tortillas to eat. We were raised to waste no food, as I grew up where we barely had enough money, especially the times in the recession. For a period of time, we did not eat much eat, not out of choice, but just because it was a little more to afford rather than our typical staples. Meat came often as a privilege, and we would definitely enjoy it more. But I do  remember a summer where everyday we ate rice, beans, and chicken. Now, we are in a lot better place, and by some blessing, we are able to eat out more easily and often we can eat tri-tip and better cuts of red meat. It is definitely a sign of wealth as Ken has said, both in present times and back in the past. Now, I almost continue to eat in the same way, eating everything off my plate, with always cooking myself beans and tortillas to have. I have not embraced the vegan diet yet, but it is something I want to pursue one day. Because of what I have learned, meat is not necessary at all for a healthy diet. I currently am eating less and less meat daily, converting to legumes for a more plant-based protein. But I still hold the principle of no wasted food true. I know that we are so privileged to have all these food to be able to eat, so it should not go to waste. There is also no sense in throwing away food that you spent hard-earned money on. I do believe Veganism is the diet of the future, and it will be exciting to see how people adapt to the diet. Plant-based diets do contribute less CO2 to the environment, which is definitely one of the better reasons to support such a diet. But I do understand there will be cultural conflict, as some have come to love staples in their diets that include meat. This can include tacos, enchiladas, spaghetti, and Pizza. But, I think it is doable and vegan alternatives can exist for many foods.

Hello, I can definitely understand where you’re coming from. I’m from a similar background where my family subsisted on a similar diet and meat was definitely a luxury during the recession. After recovering from the economic collapse, beef became more affordable and was something that I appreciated every time I ate it.
    <br><br>

Additionally, I’m on the same journey as you towards a completely vegan diet. I’m slowing inching my way to veganism by implementing more vegetables in my diet and trying out meat substitutes rather than going for regular beef, even if it’s so good. It’s been a rather difficult goal to achieve but after learning about the impact of the beef industry on the climate crisis, I’m willing to adapt and I’m happy to see that I’m not the only one!

Just as we learned in the past weeks, there are many reasons that some people or organizations feel reluctant to do something to help reduce carbon emissions. One big reason is the profit that is made by institutions like the fossil fuel companies. As there are too many countries regarding economic profit as their primary goal, it’s hard for them to give up what can help them develop just because of an issue that most people don’t experience in their daily life so far. This slowed down the entire process of saving our planet from the severe climate crisis. Thus, I think we definitely need a climate vanguard to promote people. However, we really need to think about what kind of vanguard is the one we really need. The reason I’m saying this is there were too many so-called environmental activists doing nothing except giving useless, empty speeches. As far as I’m concerned, Greta Thunberg, who became well-known by doing school strikes. I admit that she might successfully increase people’s awareness of climate issues, but some of her actions are just way too exaggerated, and I call that a “show” instead of an action against the climate crisis. Compared to Greta Thurnberg, people who are really working on solving problems deserve the title of environment vanguard. For example, there is a group of people planting trees in the desert area in China, who successfully created thousands of arcs of forests. Those people are the ones who we need to follow and admire instead of those who only know how to yelling at others with her dumb slogan.

As a pescatarian myself, I do agree with what Ken has to say in regards to animal product consumption as well as food waste.  However, I certainly do have some things I’d like to comment upon.  As Ken mentions, one of the very common reasons that people struggle to commit to a non-animal product diet, is because of cultural reasons.  I grew up Japanese, eating lots of fish.  This is one of the primary reasons that I am pescatarian as opposed to vegetarian or vegan.  While it was interesting to learn that much of the beef in cultural dishes could be because of American influence, I have to note that if I had made the decision to not eat fish at home, there would have been a lot of times that I didn’t eat.  Further, making sushi and other dishes with my mom became part of my experience growing up, and it is something that I wish to pass on to my own children.  I do feel as if I am doing my part, I haven’t eaten other meats for over ten years.  It’s become so integral to my lifestyle that I can’t imagine doing otherwise.  I am trying to limit my dairy intake currently, because I do understand that the dairy industry is nearly as bad as the beef industry, and there is also a lot of overlap between the two.  But, that gets into the Cowspiracy film from this week.  I’ll admit I do use dairy products still, but I have completely stopped with milk specifically, as there is easier access for alternatives to that.  
     <br><br>
The other thing I wanted to mention in reference to Ken’s lecture, is that he considers this switch to a mostly plant based diet to be relatively easy for the average person.  I have to disagree here.  Plant based alternatives tend to be much more expensive.  Especially on a college student budget, it makes it rather difficult to alter your lifestyle in this way.  Even at where I work, nondairy milks are an extra 70 cents in coffees.  It is not that easy for many people to make the switch.  This all being said, I do agree that we need a vanguard for these changes.  The thing about “waiting” for everyone to act together, is that it’ll never happen that way.  Without changemakers and people who spread influence, there’s no way that large amounts of people will make these changes in their lives.




</p><hr>



<p>
If we wait until everyone is onboard to take action, then we will be waiting for something that quite possibly may never happen. Not everyone is going to agree with us no matter what we do to try and convince them otherwise. It's important that we start making changes now, and we can't ease into it. Our changes need to be powerful and directly to the point. The best way to do this is to elect politicians that will steer our environmental policies into the right direction. A climate vanguard is necessary in a time like now because if we wait there is no telling what will happen. We need to start making a change, there is a lot of uncertainty in our future right now. Would you rather do something precautionarily and not have it happen, or have it happen and not have the necessary precautions in place when it does? Even a climate denier couldn't say they'd rather be unprepared and have something bad happen that they could have predicted. I feel as though its important to express our voices and to be heard in this movement. The government needs to feel the pressure of the people's voices on this matter to make a change. They won't budge if we don't continue to stand together and fight for what we know is right. I don't know about y'all, but I'm not trying to die because I never did anything to prevent our species downfall. At least if we don't solve the problem and disaster strikes, I'll die knowing I tried my best to fight it.

Vanguard is an interesting way to title this film. Vanguard is defined as “a group of people leading the way in new developments or ideas.” Our generation is supposed to lead the way for making a plant-based diet a common diet with American individuals. The Western diet is based  on a large amount of meat and little vegetables. It's going to be difficult to shift the mind of the baby boomers to change their way of life. If we act now people will follow the change in diet as a trend. Hopefully, this trend sticks. I thought it was interesting how Ken mentioned that the types of food people eat help people connect their cultures. This is true, but the American diet is the only diet based on a large amount of meat. This is not just bad for the environment but bad for health. Meat is not good for humans and was not made for humans to consume. The food waste that is currently occurring is very saddening because many low-income countries don't have food and this waste increases carbon emissions and is not consumed. We should start with small steps like implementing meatless Monday. Just one day of not eating meat worldwide may stop climate change and would be showing the meat industry that they will not profit from society as they treat the animals poorly and are a big contributor to deforestation.

First off, I agree with you that our younger generation does hold some responsibility for transitioning American households to largely plant-based diets, as we are most certainly the generation most concerned with the environmental damage caused by eating a diet high in meat. Additionally, I also fear that attempting to transition those of the "Baby Boomer" generation to a more sustainable diet will be a challenge, but I believe that placing a strong emphasis on the health benefits of a plant-based diet will convince many of them who just want to live a longer, more enjoyable life. Lastly, I am also appalled by the large amount of food waste that occurs all around us, including at the campus dining halls, local restaurants and other establishments. My hope is that more programs are created to divert this waste from landfills, so that it may be used to help those who need it.

<br><br>
In response to your statement that meat is not good for humans and was not made for our consumption, I disagree as meat does provide nutrients like vitamin B12 and iron that are absent in plants, as well as high quality, complete proteins. While I know that it is environmentally beneficial to cut out particularly damaging meats like beef and pork, I see no issue with eating local chicken or wild-caught fish on occasion, and think that this may actually be healthier for those who are unable to handle an entirely vegetarian or vegan diet.

I found some of your points in this comment to be very interesting and unique. She talks about the idea that our generation is “supposed” to be the generation that leads climate change initiatives, such as a shift in diet from meat-based to plant-based. I find it inspiring that Feder believes that the responsibility is firmly on our generation. Our whole generation needs to start thinking about the climate crisis in this way and real change will ensue. I was also intrigued by Feder’s point that meat is not only bad for humans but also not made for humans to consume. This is true, but I have not heard it said this way ever in my life. Meat comes from animals, and animals all have many distinct purposes, none of which include being killed and chopped up in hundreds of different ways for human consumption. Lastly, I found one of Hiltner’s assertions in the lecture video to be very telling. Going vegetarian or going vegan will obviously do a great deal for one’s carbon footprint. However, it is not that simple. For example, eating asparagus in the winter is not environmentally sensitive because this requires the transport of asparagus by plane from South America, which causes tons of carbon to be emitted into the atmosphere.

Yes, we need to start individually acting. And yes, we need to act together. It can never be one or the other, you have to do both to accomplish something as big as this. If we do not act individually, we cannot influence the people around us and we cannot truly say we are fighting for a bigger cause when we are not actually fighting ourselves. If we are not forming groups and acting together, our actions will not be noticed. Just going vegan, or not flying, or reducing food waste yourself is not going to do shit for the planet when so many people live here. Everyone is a contributor (okay-- not everyone. That was an exaggeration. I mean mostly people in first world countries) to this climate crisis and we cannot dig ourselves out of this giant hole without group action. And... yes, it would be so great to have a politician in office that brings light to these issues and actually takes action. But under capitalism and the form of government we currently have set up in America, I do not believe it is possible for necessary action to be taken regarding these subjects of climate change. I believe some other comments here touched on this subject much better than I can.

I think we absolutely need climate vanguards. If we were to wait for all of society to get on board before adopting a new lifestyle, it would never happen. For society as a whole to change, we need people to step up and set an example of how others can live. Climate vanguards would also serve to demonstrate different ways of helping protect our planet to those who may not know how they can help. In order for big changes to be made, there needs to be many small changes first.

What is the difference between Climatarian vs. eating what would’ve been discarded food? I see the latter being a more extreme form of Climatarianism. If that doesn’t sound appealing to you, you can always become a commentary, and by taking on eating vegetable-based foods that still provide the same nutritional value rather than beef. I think it would be beneficial for Santa Barbara’s meal plan to include commentary and options. With carbon content labels and climate crisis, additional change your labels on food such as what Denmark is doing.

I think that the obvious answer based on what this entire course has taught me so far is yes, we need a vanguard to lead the way-- we certainly have to act now and prepare a way for when the rest of the planet jumps on board. As demonstrated by Ken's example of quitting air travel and its relative effects on conferencing, there are many moving parts that are associated with dropping our (destructive) habits and pleasures. It's necessary to have people adopt a more environmentally-friendly lifestyle to work out the difficulties, and ultimately discover a viable lifestyle that will encourage the rest of the planet to hop on board and make the transition smoother. This completely oversimplifies the situation, but the general idea and necessity for a vanguard remains. This begins with changing our practices on an individual level, while encouraging and educating others along the way. Ken's lecture made me realize how vital it is to be aware of our choices when we make decisions with the environment in mind. Switching to a plant-based diet can be just as harmful if it is not done correctly or monitored closely.

I also think that changing our behaviors on an individual level can have a large impact on society. Whether this impact will be large enough is unclear. However, I really don't see any drawbacks to it. A vanguard would at worst be harmless and at best could influence the minds and behaviors of people around the world. As Ken mentioned, it is inevitable that we eventually phase out aviation and diets high in meat. Doing it voluntarily would definitely be easier than by force.

I think Ken’s online conference model is brilliant. It reminds me of how big corporations would skype for their meetings instead of flying back and forth. I feel like this implementation will be more widely accepted than we think. Sort of like the idea of going paperless. People are switching to iPads rather than using traditional notebooks. I believe that with where our technology is heading today, people would be more inclined to participate. However, the topic of food will always remain difficult to discuss. As a kid, you don’t really have a choice in what you eat. You will eat what your parents feed you. As a result, your appetite is kind of fixed to a certain extent. What we eat is a shared experience if you are not financially independent. We have more of a freedom now than we did before because most of us don’t live at home anymore. Switching an entire diet is hard. You might be intrigued to try new vegan dishes, but would you want to incorporate that into your meal planning in the future? I believe the most effective way is to find vegetarian or vegan dishes that you like and add that to your list. 
<br><br>

The fact that eating meat is a sign of affluence might not be as prominent anymore because I personally know a lot of people who want to go vegan but are still reluctant because of the price of vegan items. I think there needs to be a healthy balance of educating people that they don’t need to buy all these soy products. Being vegan means you can consume all the veggies you want and there are definitely cheaper options than buying all these processed foods. I think you shouldn’t go vegan just because it’s trendy or you want to do it to lose weight. Do it for the right reason. I applaud Denmark’s effort on planning to become a carbon neutral country, but I’m not sure if putting carbon labels on food is necessary. I like the idea of taxing carbon at its supplier level, but when you doing things in consumers’ faces, it might create a negative stigma after all.

We do need a leader to raise people’s awareness of how severe the climate change is affecting us. I know that I am not the one, but we do need someone who can strongly point out the effects of climate change. Other than that, for the third time, Prof. Hiltner said that people should really vote for the participants who realize how bad climate changes is and what it is doing to the rest of the world. In fact, people who are really in power now in the US is mainly those who are denying the fact that the climate is changing.

Just this morning, I received the news that Jeff Bezos is giving ten billion dollars to fight climate change. He will be launching a new initiative called the Bezos Earth Fund. I think prominent figures like him set a great example of how influential people can help save the Earth. I personally also really like Biden’s “Clean Energy Revolution” campaign. It ensures that the US achieves a 100% clean energy economy by 2050, the $400 billion investment in energy and climate research, the recommitment of the US to the Paris Agreement, polluters stop abusing their power against communities of color and low-income families. I believe that these are a great start for us to fight climate change and it’s important to be aware of what each candidate wants to do.

To answer your question, I think that of course, ideally, we’ll start acting now and maybe influence other people to do so but I also don’t know how much of an effect this will have. If we really want to make a difference, the government will have to impose legislation to make us. I really agree with having a carbon tax. The main reason that many Americans would stop supporting companies or agencies that are bad for the environment, or at least support less, is if they had a reason to do so. Unfortunately, the simple moral reason is not enough. If Americans were taxed and would, therefore, have to spend more money if they wanted to purchase something that leads to a lot of carbon emissions, they would think twice about buying it and probably search for alternatives.
<br><br>

Furthermore, I agree that our family and the people that we are around really affect our diets. I know that it is important to my family to have barbecues and we would never have a meal that doesn't include either meat or dairy. Before I came to college, I thought it was insane that there are people who have plant-based diets because all of my food revolved around meat and dairy. Once I got to college and took your classes, I now understand how not only is it possible, it is preferable considering how important it is that the world switches to a plant based diet. I used to go In-N-Out a lot and would always get a double double but, now, I would rather just get fries because it has become less appealing to me. I know a full switch to veganism would be very difficult and I’m not sure if I would be able to do it, but I really want to eat less meat and opt for vegan options when I can. I also want to eat healthier and a plant-based diet could help with that as well.

I would agree with you on her approach to veganism.  I feel very bad for the animals and want to eat less meat and more of a plant-based diet but it is very difficult for me since almost all meals I eat contain some sort of meat or animal product.  I also agree with the carbon tax but I do admit that I want to travel across seas and ships ain't it honestly.  I also want to study abroad with the school and in order to do that I have to take a flight to get to a location, I want to study in.  Support for the carbon tax is not as high as we need it to be however to become in effect.  Not to mention how much anti-carbon tax voters and officials there is.  However, with time I think more people are going to college and are getting educated about this topic hence this class and will make a difference in voting and make an impact on the world for the better.  Sadly, with the conditions right now on climate change, I think there is still not enough of support to overthrow the people against the issue and honestly I think if the whole world was 100 percent against climate change I think we would still be suffering effects from climate change from what was done in the past and can not be changed.

I see myself as someone would care about the climate change crisis, I am willing to become a environmental friendly person, but don’t see myself as a climate vanguard because I simply haven't done enough to our environment yet; however, I do think we need more vanguard to promote the idea of climate crisis and the urgent action need to be taken to tackle the issue. 
<br><br>


I think each of us can of course do something in our lives to help change the climate crisis situation  allittle by changing our daily lifestyle/ pattern. But still, I think a lot of the power depends on the politician and the leader of the government in each country. Policies like carbon tax can help relieve the problem a little bit but it is still not enough as we can the the bad impacts we put on our environment is much faster than the action we can take to solve the problems. So, what we need is a much larger and well organized/planned plans and policies and some vanguard that truly care about the issue and taking a bigger steps on leading people to make a more obvious changes.

<br><br>

A lot of the things like eating habits and consumption patterns are very personal and each of us have the right to choose what we want to do.e.g to eat. To buy,etc. The major reason why people refuse to take action and refuse to admit the problems or are not taking enough actions to address the issue are because either it will hurt their financial benefits or simply brings them inconvenience. However, if we don;t care about what we do to our earth and rely on other people for changes, we are not moving forward toward our goals and the problem can never be solved. So, I think everyone of us need to think ourselves as someone who have the ability to make changes and spread the knowledge and information we know to other people so everyone will turn their knowledge into power to save the planet we are living.

Really agree what u said.On earth, human plants and animals are actually an interdependent "biosphere" and "friend circle", and no one can do without others. Humans can survive on earth because of ecological balance. The earth provides us, human beings, and all life forms, with a life support system-air, water, appropriate light and heat, energy, and so on.This primitive ecological balance is extremely rare from a global perspective, and we may only see it today where human beings have never been involved. While the natural environment provides environmental resources for human survival and development, it has been greatly damaged by human machines. Only when the natural environment is in harmony with an ecological balance can the outlook for humanity be optimistic.

I'm on the same page as you, Wahyan. I find the topic of climate change incredibly important and something all of us should be discussing on a local, national and worldwide level in order to start addressing problems that will soon have irreversible affect on our planet. However, I too have not been vocal or active enough. I think part of helping such a big problem is insighting change within our own lifestyle and discussing the topic with as amny people as we can. While I don't think I could ever consider myself a vanguard, I do think I am capable of teaching other people some key facts about the current state of this issue, especially thanks to this class.

<br><br>

I also agree that we need a carbon tax, while so many may think this is extremist or un-benneficial, the outcome of taxing products and services that simply have too much of a negative impact on our climate and earth our worth the price and will most likely serve to re-shape our consumption culture. I think everyone should pick an aspect of their life they're excited or at-least willing to change and look into the many options and ways in which they can be doing better for the future of our environment. Unfortunately, I hold negative perspective on people's willingness to change by their own accord which is why I think imposing taxes and implementing laws that stop people from over-consuming and producing so much waste are key to addressing this issue.

I found Ken's mention of Denmark placing a carbon fact on the items we buy extremely interesting. I applaud Denmark for being innovative and being proactive rather than reactive. I personal think that we as a country should feel embarrassed for this mess that we have mainly caused. The US is supposed to be a world leader, a country for others to look up too. Yet, our culture that has led to climate change is less than something to be proud of. We consume meat at such a large rate, waste tons of food, and import goods from all over the world. Our consumption is giving people the wrong image to look up to. Instead of innovating new ways to combat climate change and show the world how we can save ourselves, we continue to show the world what not to do. It's saddening that a smaller country like Denmark has the intuition to be proactive and aim to be a zero emissions country, while the largest countries in the world are doing nothing but making the matters worse. Our culture is too consumed with consuming and we must open our eyes and realize how we are making matters worse, and we must change our eating habits for one, to prevent this disaster we are driving ourselves into.

 I totally agree with your idea. I think most of the countries in this world need to learn from Denmark. The way they deal with carbon dioxide, trash, pollutions are just brilliant. IF every country can does it like Denmark, I believe that the speed of the melting iceberg would be slower. A lot of well developed countries does not do much on the protection of the earth. Many of them should be the leaders of the world, but they failed to let their people realize the importance of the climate crisis. America and Russia and EU releases more than two thirds carbon dioxide around the world. It’s right that people have the right to approach and enjoy the best technologies around world. But we really have to consider the health of our earth. Let see another example: Japan. Japan is a small country in Asia. They don’t have much space decompose all the trash, so they did a very serious trash separation, that they can almost recycle anything and reuse it. Anyone who does not follow the trash separation would be punished hard.

“The irony is that she may well be reclaiming a heritage corrupted by American consumerism in the 21st century.” 
<br><br>
It is a bit of a cultural shock for me to see just how Denmark is so responsible in trying to mitigate carbon footprint as a developed country compared to the United States. I think it fundamentally comes down to the difference in Denmark's socialistic approach to solving problems in a way that will benefit everybody. I agree with you on the notion that we must resist modern consumerism and change our diet because modern consumerism is too fast-paced to the point where waste is just a by-product as long as there is profit for corporates. By changing our diet and reducing food waste altogether, we can reduce more than 137 gigatons of greenhouse gas emission while also improving efficiency of food production and actually feed a lot more people who would otherwise starve.

“Either we do or we don’t.” But what exactly are we supposed to be doing? Ken stated in the video that many people will not make the changes to help save the planet until we are required to do so, and although it is true, it is also hypocritical. Going back onto the reading this week, the number one factor that will help combat climate change is refridgertorial management, yet all we continue to speak upon as the end all be all solutions are changing how fast you shower and going vegan. Yet, even Ken states how going vegan wouldn’t make a difference either. If there are repercussions for all of these so-called solutions, how will we save the planet?
<br><br>

Ken states in the video that being vegan may not even be the best solution, because eating vegetables like asparagus in the winter are flown in from South America and do the same damage as eating chicken or pork. Even vegetables hold a severe carbon footprint from flying! There is a lot of talk about ‘starting now’ or else we will face the end of our planet as we know it- but what exactly are we supposed to start doing? Is there any way we can actually help because we aren’t part of the 1% who run the agricultural or terrotrial industries? I want to make a change, I really do. But it is quite difficult to do so when there are more repercussions than ever.

I was thinking the exact same thing you were while watching the video, especially when it comes to food systems. Reducing food waste seems simple enough, and I try my best to do so for the meals that I cook myself. However, this is very difficult to do in the dining halls since all the food comes to us prepared and we therefore have to influence over the food waste that happens during the preparation process. And, opting out of eating in the dining halls is not financially doable for many students since all students living in dorms are required to buy a meal plan, and the smallest meal plan is one meal a day. 
<br><br>
Changing the kind of food we eat is even more complicated! I became vegetarian because of the climate crisis, but now I know that even eating vegan is not good for the planet if you're not eating seasonally and locally. I would really like to eat seasonally and locally, but I do not know how and is pretty difficult for a busy college student who is trying to cook budget-friendly meals as quickly as possible. I love the idea of Denmark putting environmental labels on food, and I would love the US to do so as well, but that is not necessarily in line with the "individual climate vanguard" theme of the video. It would be extraordinarily beneficial for Ken to teach us HOW to eat locally and seasonally rather than just telling us that we should do so. Many of us, evidenced by the fact that we are taking this class, want to be climate vanguards, but just need a little help getting there. I didn't take this class to be convinced to be a climate activist; I already strive to be one. I took this class in hopes that I could have an expert tell me what is beneficial, and is not, and exactly how to act in order to help mitigate the climate crisis. I really hope Ken dedicates lecture time to doing so.


<br><hr>
I would have to agree with this comment. Some of the statements made in this class are somewhat contradictory, and to be honest, I am starting to get confused about what the point of what we should be doing is. We should only eat plant based foods, but even plant based foods are flown out, and flying is the worst thing we could do environmentally. Additionally, we learned that the biggest impact we could make on the climate crisis is to reduce the population and switch to a purely plant based diet. What are we supposed to be doing? More than anything, I feel as if this is just teaching me that we dug ourselves a hole that is way too deep and there is no way to get out. 
<br><br>


I am not sure if I am just dumb, or if this is actually confusing. I am still uncertain about where I come into this equation and what I am supposed to be doing to help make a change. What is the biggest thing that I am supposed to be doing? I know that we are supposed to be applying all of these concepts to little parts of our lives, but I am not sure about which things are going to make  too many negative impacts as well.

Hi Ken, I definitely want to be a part of the climate vanguard that takes charge in paving a new sustainable future for our society. But I am hesitant to claim this title because of my love of meat. If I tried a mainly plant based diet I feel like I would not enjoy the food and never be full. I know this sounds naive and I’m sure there are ways to find fulfilling food that is plant based, it's just that I honestly couldn't imagine living life without the occasional chicken tenders or chick fila chicken sandwich. For real ken have you ever had In n Out? The 4 by 4 hits different.
<br><br>

My question to you Ken is as follows:  is there anything I can do to lower my co2 footprint in regard to food choice while simultaneously eating meat. In other words, are there certain brands or organizations that have more sustainable reputations?

I also have this question for Ken. While I do consider myself more environmentally aware than the average person, I do eat occasional meat products simply because of convenience as a college student. While I think In n Out's 4x4 is excessive (sorry!), I think that eating meat has become something I fall back to when it seems like my "only" option. I understand I am very much capable of making a stronger effort to go the plant-based route, but after a busy day of studying or even getting sick of eating what seems like the only vegetarian option at the dining hall other than salad which is pizza, it gets repetitive and also inconvenient. I want to be part of the climate vanguard but I do feel that my dietary choices are pushing me back even though my hesitant transition to plant-based is better than being a frequent meat-eater.



</span></div><hr>


<p>
My short answer to Ken’s question is yes, we should begin acting now. We know that change is coming whether we like it or not, so why not be ahead of the game? It’s not as if living a more sustainable and environmentally conscious lifestyle will make you any less happy or satisfied, if anything making changes to your diet and overall consumption can help improve your life and increase overall happiness. Those who refuse to make small changes in their lives now are going to find themselves stuck in a situation where they have to make huge changes in the future, and will probably look back and wish they went vegetarian or forwent flying.
<br><br>
Although it may be daunting to change the way you live your life when a majority of the people surrounding you aren’t willing to do the same, I think that it is important to do what you think is best and what you believe to be the “right” thing to do. Also, if you make changes to your lifestyle, it could inspire people around you to do the same, which is a win-win situation for everyone. Eventually, everyone will have to start changing their lives to better our planet, it doesn’t hurt to get a head start and live a better life while doing it.

I totally agree, that we cannot wait for everyone to be on board we must continue to fight against climate change. I believe that it will work like a snowball effect people will hop on board when they feel that they need to do something about climate change. Waiting for everyone is just not an option. Ken mentions that going vegetarian is not always better for the environment for example asparagus in certain seasons contribute to more CO2 because of the air travel. Putting labels on foods is a great way to inform the consumer on their carbon footprint however I think people should be informed on how to use this or read it. If not then putting a label on a product would be useless. Ken also talks about conferences in which many professors use air travel to get there but by using technology one can have the online conference in their house or pretty much anywhere and still be able to virtually attend the conference. I think that we must educate everyone, I realized that in fact I knew very little about how I can do something to fix climate change. I was unaware how much air travel contributes to climate change and that simply going vegetarian is not always the best option.

Okay, first and foremost, I’d like to say that I agree with Ken’s overarching ideas on climate change, but there are certainly flaws in some things that he says. For starters, a carbon tax on corporations seems like a good thing in theory, and in some cases it may actually work. However, I think Ken is taking an approach that I don’t necessarily agree with 100%. I’d like to say that I am not entirely educated on this subject, so take this for what it’s worth, these are just my two cents on the situation. I think that a carbon tax should be used to limit companies’ uses of whatever they are doing that pollutes the environment. I don’t think it should be used to create inhibitions for everyday people. I’m referring to the airplane example. I agree that people should lower their air travel unless absolutely necessary, but a lot of people don’t have the means to spend more and more money on a potentially increasing ticket price when an airplane is the only way that they can travel for important reasons like to see their families who live far away, for example. A carbon tax should not burden the common everyday individual in my opinion.

I agree with your reasoning here. While a lot of what Ken talks about seems simple enough and manageable, certain things are just a bit unreasonable. While some people may choose to not ride planes and only use public transportation or bike/walk everywhere, plane travel is a major aspect of everyday life. Even if people cut down on personal trips, many Americans and people in general need to travel for work. While video chat may be suitable for certain occasions such as meetings, face to face interactions are necessary and unavoidable in some cases. Currently, there are not suitable alternative for long distance travel. While trains may be used to travel within a country, it can be pretty inconvenient to days in a train when you can take a couple hour flight. As for switching to strictly plant based diets, I can't see a whole country doing it. While I am sure more and more people will continue to do it, there are just too many people who are attached to certain meats and, in my opinion, not enough good replacement options out there. Hopefully, as technology progresses and new developments are made, both of these situations can become more reasonable.

Yes, we need a vanguard, but I sadly think we aren’t going to get one. Although I obviously do not want to wait around for everyone to act, having a vanguard isn’t going to quickly make everyone change their traditions and behaviors. Especially with the older generation, I think it will be impossible to persuade them to stop consuming their beef. I hate to say it, but I think the only possible way to get plant-based going is with the younger generation. We would probably have to wait until the younger generation is in power to do something about it.
<br><br>

Personally, becoming vegan or even vegetarian would be very difficult in my household. When I lived at home, I always thought about switching diets for health reasons. I never switched because I knew I wouldn’t be able to eat the food that my mom made for dinner, or food at family parties. Not that it would be a disgrace to not eat meat, I think it is just extremely difficult. I’ve grown up with my mom asking “Chicken or beef?” when preparing for dinner because it has always been a given to have one or the other. Now that I live here at UCSB, I know I can much easily transition out of meat consumption.
<br><br>

Hearing about climate labels was very interesting and completely new to me. I think it is a good step into making people aware of what they are eating. I would have not known about the effects of eating asparagus in the winter because I would have just assumed that because it is a vegetable it is better.

I too never had imagined the thought of being vegan while at home, it seemed impossible with the heavy meat consumption that my family ate. Transitioning vegan at UCSB was such an easy transition for me. I honestly thought it would be nearly impossible with the way I ate at home with my family. It just goes to show how heavily influenced family and culture can be on a person's diet and beliefs about diets. When I told my family they did not believe it and thought I would go home and consume meat, but my visits home was just myself making my own vegan meals contrary to whatever they were eating.  They became curious of the foods I was eating, they tried it, they loved it. Now they are not vegans nor vegetarians but they are eating some plant-based meals which are a small, yet still a step in the right direction. And I think it is important to share these experiences and let people know that different is not necessarily worse. And I too did not know about the effects of asparagus during the wrong season. And it honestly inspired me to do some research on my own about what I was consuming. While luckily I had time to do some research not everyone does which is why I thought the climate labels was such an amazing idea.  I really really REALLY hope that this is something that can be implemented in California and all over the country soon. I think seeing these will definitely help people be more conscious of what they're buying.

I agree with the professor that some people don’t want to inconvenience themselves by changing their lifestyle in order to protect the environment. Sometimes, they read an article about the climate crisis, and know the consequences of the climate crisis. They decide to change their lifestyle in order to protect the planet. But, unfortunately, a lot of them just can do it a few days, or a few weeks. It is hard to make a change, especially under the situation of giving up a lot of things. However, I think some solution is easy for us to take action, such as reducing food waste. At my friend’s birthday party, we ordered 8 pizzas, and half of the pizzas were thrown away after the party. We waste a lot of food every day. The food we waste is responsible for roughly 8% of global emissions.
<br><br>
I think in lower-income countries, we can improve infrastructure for storage, processing, and transportation is essential; in higher-income regions, major interventions are needed at the retail and consumer levels. National food-waste targets and policies can encourage widespread change.
<br><br>
We also can protect the planet by use energy wisely, consume less, and so on. We need to make changes to protect our planet now.

I have often wondered why Americans eat so much meat compared to other countries and Ken’s explanation finally gave me an answer. Just as we use our things to show how much money we have, we use our food to show how much money we have. This increased the amount of meat that Americans eat, and over time it has just become normal to eat a diet focused around meat. I think that vegan meat alternatives such as the Impossible or Beyond burgers are a great place to start for converting people to a plant-based diet. These replacements allow people to eat the same meals they typically would and have the same cultural experience but without the impact of meat in their diet. I think that as people learn to love these replacements, they will then slowly filter more and more real meat and dairy products out of their diet.

<br><br>

Plant-based meat and dairy replacements are great, but as Ken mentioned, that does not solve all of our problems. It was interesting to learn that asparagus has such a high climate footprint because it has to be flown to the US from South America. This made me think about the produce that I buy and how small things like buying Californian instead of Mexican avocados can even have a difference. I love the method that Denmark is creating with their climate labels on food products. I think that this would make it much easier for consumers in their attempt to reduce their climate footprints, and I hope it comes to the US.
<br><br>


As for Kens question on making changes and if we should start now or wait for everyone to get on board, I believe that we have to start now. To be frank, people are lazy. If we do not start now, people will never join because they don’t want to do the dirty work of getting the ball rolling. But if people (like the students in the class) start now, then we can create options for others to make it easier for them to join and adapt. However, this change has to go beyond personal changes, it must be cultural. This class has made me more motivated than ever to vote and be involved in my countries decisions, and I hope that it has done the same for everyone else.

Something that stood out to me in this lecture was when Ken explained that eating asparagus in the winter is almost equivalent to eating chicken or other meats. Since the start of this class, I have been eating a much more plant-based diet and barely eating meat at all. This is why the incorporation of the climate labels to me at least would be extremely helpful. Since this was my first time hearing about such a thing I hope that this idea is spread and actually becomes a reality in the United States. Another huge thing that stood out to me was the importance of decreasing the amount of food we waste. The first thing that I thought of was our own dining halls here on campus. I am frightened to actually know how much food is wasted but I am aware that it is already a huge amount. Seeing as to how this is such a huge part of the problem of food in relation to climate change, I want to somehow influence the change of the dining hall concept to reduce the amount of food that is wasted. I remember in sixth grade when my class went on a trip to Astrocamp in Idyllwild and after every meal they would ask for us to separate our trash into extra food and our actual trash. I thought that this was extremely peculiar so I asked one of the counselors why they did this. He briefly explained that the entire camp was conducting a study on how much food they waste in an attempt to be more sustainable. At the time I had very little idea about what he was talking about, but now I really appreciate their efforts. I hope that maybe the dining halls here can invoke change to create less food waste and move towards creating changes in our system that will actually produce positive results. One of the dining halls on campus called Ortega has a lunch once in a while that is called meatless monday and even has a table devoted to educating students about the climate crisis. I was so happy to see this and encouraged all my friends to go to Ortega that day just to support meatless mondays and hopefully show them that their students do care. If every dining hall switched off with meatless mondays or made it a more frequent occurrence the impact we as a campus could make alone is extreme.

This was my first time also hearing about these labels and I think that this would be really great to implement! Now that I go to the grocery alone I pay a lot more attention to what I buy and I would definitely notice the labels and take it into great consideration when shopping. 
<br><br>
As for Kens question about whether we should wait for everyone to join us in this process or start on our own I think we should definitely set the example. I agree that we need to make change quickly and why not start now even if it’s not many individuals. 
<br><br>
I know we waste a lot of food at the dining commons and it’s sad to think about. At first I thought about all the people that are out in the cold hungry without any income and could eat the food. Now, I still think about the people that can be fed by the excess of food we have but also the damage we can end if we ate far less meat and dairy products. Again, I understand that we can not implement such a diet due to different reasons like money but for those of us that can make the change we should!

I agree that climate labels would be extremely beneficial to help us make more sustainable choices when consuming food because there is so much that goes into consumption that we don’t even know. We take nutrition labels and our own health so seriously, but are ignoring the impact our food is having on the environment. I also agree that while it is important to adopt a plant based diet, our real focus needs to be on food waste. We waste ⅓ to ½ of the food produced, which as a wealthy society we take advantage of. If we reduced our food waste not only would we be reducing our carbon footprint we also would be making more food available for the rest of the population. I think the experiment your camp did is something that our dining halls should definitely incorporate because whenever I go to bring my dishes up I am appalled by how much food is left over. One thing I do to make sure I am not grabbing more food than I need is to grab one plate at a time and go back only if I finish the food I already have. I almost wonder if we switched from a system of unlimited food for a swipe to individually paying for the food we eat, people would make more conscious decisions about how much food they take. We need to all be climate vanguards and take these actions now instead of waiting until we have to. If young people like Greta Thunberg can dedicate their whole lives to architecting a better future for us all, we can all make the simple changes necessary to reduce our footprint. Not only do we need to make changes ourselves we need to rise up to convince the politicians in power to make these changes too. The time to act is now, because we do not have a lot of time left.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your statement regarding climate labels. Just as people pay attention to the nutrition facts on their food, I believe that they would pay attention to the climate impact of their food choices if it was printed on the label. Making sustainable food choices is extremely important, and I think everyone would be willing to do so, especially  if the option is easy for them. Many people have nothing against eating sustainably, however, not everyone wants to take the effort to inform themselves on whether what they’re eating is environmentally friendly or not. Because of this, I believe that climate labels could prove to be very successful, as the information is provided to the consumer right as they’re deciding to purchase something.

<br><br>

In response to Ken’s question, I definitely believe that action needs to happen now. The climate crisis is a time-sensitive issue, and if we continue to wait, remediation of our planet will become even more challenging. Inaction as a response to climate destruction is dangerous, as it could lead to an endless cycle of both a worsening climate and negligence.

I agree that food choice is influenced by culture. I grew up eating and get familiar with many dishes with pork. I have been trying to not eat beef for the past 3 weeks, but I still find it hard to not eat pork. Pork isn't as bad as beef in terms in  CO2 emission, but it's still red meat. A few challenges I see is how I'm going to change my diet, especially when I'm at home, I rely on my mom's cooking. I think it's tedious to ask my mom  to make dishes that doesn't have meat in them for me. I think I'm going to take more steps, I see how much meat and dairy I can cut off from my diet.

I do think that we need a climate vanguard. I think that nowadays almost everyone knows climate crisis exist and that if we don't start acting now, our planet is going to become uninhabitable for us. Yet, only a small portion of people is willing to act. I feel like our attitude toward climate crisis is like when your mom tells you and your siblings to take out the trash. All of you know you have to but no one wants to be the first person to get out of the couch and take the trash out. Climate crisis is obviously a much more serious issue than taking out the trash. To me, the more serious and complicated the issue is, the less willing I am to touch on it. Because I know that once I started, all the issues surrounding this one are going to pop up and it will seem like it's taking forever to be done. If I have a leader of some sort, I would be able to do my part of the task so much better. Just like CO2 emission, making more environmentally friendly choices takes a long time to see the results, so maybe people just need a monitor of some sort telling them that they are doing a great job.

I have read a few comments that have a problem with Ken's use of the word "Vanguard." While I can understand my peers' concerns, I think we need not to think of a vanguard in military terms when speaking about the climate. I cannot speak for Ken, but I am sure a climate vanguard simply means gathering a group of people to go forward and address the climate crisis, together and individually.
<br><br>
On another note, I found this video a little frustrating because I feel as though I am doing all I can to help the climate crisis, but week after week I'm being told it's not good enough (for example last week's flying video) and this week's comparison that eating asparagus during the winter is worse than eating chicken because of where it's flown from. I appreciate Ken being honest with us, but it is a little frustrating because it feels like it's a lose-lose scenario. Yes, food labels would be great in order to find out how the climate is affected by certain foods we eat, but I am left wondering how honest the labels would even be. After last week's video (the patriot act) revealed that the tag stating "recycled" is quite literally for the tag only and not the clothes, I am left wondering about the honesty behind a climate food label. Being a vegetarian for almost a year now and trying to take the bus as much as possible and not supporting fast-fashion brands are all my attempts to help the climate, but it is frustrating when these efforts (which are truth VERY hard for me) are always being undermined by comparisons and dishonesty from the industries. I guess the point of my comment this week is to just express my frustration because it's a reality we must face when trying to help the climate: constant frustration.

I agree with a lot of the points you made in your comment. I think that the specific use of the word "vanguard" in the case of climate change does not necessarily imply the military aspect of the word and I feel that a lot of people are focusing on the word itself too much. Vanguard can also simply mean, "a group of people leading the way in new developments or ideas". I do feel like people are specifically picking on it because the word is very uncommonly used, and whenever it is, it is used militarily, so therefore it caused a lot of debate about it. I feel like Ken was probably try to call for more than just a "movement", as they are shown to not be enough to truly help the environment, and therefore picked on using "vanguard". In response to this, I do think that we need an environmental vanguard, in terms of a group of people that are dedicated and specifically calling to action. Climate movements are already on the rise, especially with Greta Thunberg now leading the charge and being the face of the mass movement. But, instead of just having Greta bear the weight of carrying the climate movement, more people need to stand up and be at the front lines in order to cause a mass effect. I understand that being at the front lines is dangerous and undesirable, however, if a 17-year old can lead this movement, why can't the adults stand up to be there with her?
<br><br>
I also do agree that the continuous facts that whatever we do, we are emitting CO2 and hurting the environment is a bit frustrating. In fact, there is not really a practical solution to be carbon neutral in the current world and culture we live in. I think this goes back to the previous lecture about changing our culture. This definitely needs to happen first before an of us individuals can truly make an impact on helping the climate crisis.

To be honest in the past couple weeks I’ve gotten quite discouraged that the sweeping changes to actually address the climate crisis are actually possible. These are two separate categories that I feel like changes to address the crisis fall into: from the top down, and from the bottom up, the first being politicians/government actions that “force” society to change, and the other being grassroots movements that cause cultural change (and possibly also then governmental action). What I have become discouraged about the most is that this needed cultural change would be possible, at least at the level needed. 
<br><br>

Being someone who likes to often look back at history I myself find myself looking backward for a present to compare this “cultural change” to. The best example I can think of for this would be the Civil Rights movement, which unfortunately isn’t one of the time periods I know very well, but what I fear is that it exemplifies how the level of this needed cultural change might not be achievable (because any cultural movement simply could not go far enough), and it reminds me of the example Ken mentioned in class of the ripped/acid washed jeans anti-consumerism protest of the 1960s just got manipulated into just another market to drive the consumerism machine.
<br><br>

Oh course if social changes would not achieve what the planet needs then the only possible alternative to combat the system that will wreck the planet would be “revolution,” though at the same time I can’t say it probably would be a great idea considering 99% of political revolutions end worse than what was before (with the american revolution being a notable exception). The parallel I want to draw here with history that I can explain slightly better than the last one would be the attempts for communist revolution in the first half of the 20th century. The marxists wanted to overthrow the capitalist/imperialist system, but it was much too deeply implanted and strong for them to really be able to do so. During the outbreak of World War One, Benito Mussolini (who was actually a communist at the time), proposed that the marxists needed to actually support their countries efforts in the Great War because it would lead to the imperialist system destroying itself enough for communism to be able to rise. As a side note he actually was kicked out of the italian socialist movement for this pro-war view which eventually led him down the road of fascism. My point however with all of this if big oil and consumerist society fail to reform enough to address climate change then at some point this will lead to their complete destruction. Whether it is possible to actually achieve this needed reform would be quite preferable, because complete collapse would be quite bad for anyone actually living in the world. I just at this present moment am discouraged that we can actually achieve this needed change fast enough.

The struggle of sweeping cultural change is the most intimidating part of the climate crisis. It is far easier for people to turn a blind eye and pretend like they are helping in other less impactful ways, like electric cars and LED lights. It scares me to think that cultural changes are so important because I do not see the general population actually making the changes they need to in order to save our planet. Systematic changes like a carbon tax are the clear solution to inciting cultural change, but I do not see the majority of people supporting something like a carbon tax. It simply has too much impact on the average person's day to day life for people to be willing to vote on it. While this is an incredibly pessimistic view, I'm scared of people's stubbornness to change and how it will slow our efforts to save the planet. This thinking has opened my eyes to the fact that it truly is on my generation to make the necessary changes. As a new generation is becoming able to vote, it is on us to step up and use our voice for good. Being pioneers in our personal action, and using legislation to change our culture is the only way that we can help create social change.


<br><hr>
Your point about top-down versus bottom-up change reminds me of an interesting topic in sociology. While it may be difficult for a few politicians to get environmentally-conscious bills passed (as well as have them enforced), another option is to start social movements that begin with everyday people like us. Like Ken mentioned, this doesn’t mean unplugging our phone chargers and switching our lightbulbs. It does mean becoming educated on the issue and prioritizing the issues that are most impactful to the climate crisis, such as our food and clothing choices. Furthermore, as more people express concern over the importance of climate change, those in positions of political power are more inclined to act as well. For example, many politicians were invested in the climate crisis in 2008 when the public indicated its importance. However, it has lost popularity since the overall investment in it has also decreased, largely in part of climate deniers. This is why we need to start with change on the individual level, which hopefully gains enough momentum to engender change from higher authorities as well.

I think that we should certainly NOT wait. What I have learned so far in this course, is that waiting does far more harm than good. By standing up and taking action, the climate crisis can begin to be mitigated. This lecture talked a lot about air travel and I do not like to admit that I am a major culprit of this. I constantly talk about I try to reduce my footprint on the daily through not eating meat, not owning a car, and not using an excessive amount of electricity. However, I do have relatives in Europe which I travel to see twice a year. In these two times a year, I am nearly doubling my carbon footprint. This makes me frustrated because I do not want to harm the earth, but I do like visiting my family.
<br><br>

This has made me really start to think about ways travel can be made more earth-friendly. In previous lectures, Ken mentioned a high speed train from Los Angeles to New York City. If this existed, I would definitely choose that over flying, even though it could potentially take more time. Then, from NYC to Europe, I could either take a shorter plan ride or hopefully in the future there would be an underground train of some sorts. I have a passion for travel but the carbon emissions that it costs the earth are extremely unappealing. I'd love to do more research on ways to travel without skyrocketing carbon emissions. I think in terms of educational conferences, Ken's idea to maximize the use of computer technology could be really beneficial. This can also be applied to staying connected with family living in different countries.

The impact and benefits of switching to a plant based diet are undeniable. The negative effects of food waste is well documented and well known. I think that people know about these issues, but simply do not want to switch. If you are asking if we have time to wait, then you are essentially asking if we should force people into action or wait. I think the solutions you propose can indeed be radical at times. I do believe that the carbon tax is good and that I should vote for people that support the tax but what if these people didn't have good other good views. It's a complex issue. I don't know if it warrants us as society to start forcing behavioral changes and societal changes. These changes need to be done one way or the other. But in the same way that there are many factors that are bringing the environment down, I believe that there are many potential factors that could bring the planet up, we just need to realize them and bring them to action.  Breaking it down into a political issue makes it all the more complex. But surely for any real change to be brought about, there would need to be some sort of political action. All I know for sure is the positive benefits of a plant based diet so why not change?

<p>
A main theme about this class that I have noticed is that there needs to be change.  Individual change, political change, societal change - but this video really outlines how.  It sounds great; of course I want to stop flying and eat a largely plant-based diet… but it is more difficult than it sounds.  This is why not many Americans have fit it into their lifestyle.  Many people look at their day to day necessities of themselves and their loved ones, and are either unaware or believe (falsely) that it is too hard to pay attention to saving our Earth.  So they think, “other people will deal with it”.  The problem is, if not everyone makes a change, like Ken says, there will not be a big enough impact to decrease carbon emissions to a safe level.  What is actually scarier to me is that even I, someone educated on the impacts of climate change, have a hard time adhering to the suggestions Ken gives.  No matter how much I want to stop eating meat, sometimes I choose the easier rather than the better route. This is something I need to work on, and fast.  I have to remind myself that even one person can make a difference.
 <br><br>
The one thing I am skeptical about, though, is the idea behind the carbon tax.  Yes, it sounds great in theory, but to me it sounds like it would create a bigger divide between the lower and high classes.  As the top 1% would still be able to afford the carbon tax, they would probably still ride in their private jets and such, which we have already established is even worse for our environment than commercial flights as it increases the carbon footprint per capita dramatically.  Meanwhile, most of the rest of the country would pay money they don’t have to account for the emissions from gas, electricity, and food.  Much of middle America cannot afford an electric vehicle, so that would be another burden too.  Of course, it would increase the amount of people using public transit which is good environmentally, but the systems we have now are not sufficient.  Before we opt for a large carbon tax, we have to make sure to give the people good alternatives to avoid push backs on what is necessary to save our environment.
<br><br>
 Finally, I am so excited that Ken brought up how important it is to be active politically.  For me, this will be my first time being old enough to vote, so I feel very honored and gung-ho about it.  I know some people are ignorant to how big a deal even one vote can be, but having Ken advocate awareness is key to influencing so many people.

I completely agree with Ken in regards to reducing our carbon footprint as an entire planet. He may have made it sound more simple than it really is. Asking people, especially the older generations, to stop flying altogether is a hard sell. Hundreds of thousands of people rely on flying every year just to keep their jobs, visit family, and vacation. Reducing airtime when it comes to traveling for leisure will be more easily cut back on considering it is not necessary to do so for any means. Taking a mass transit system is a great alternative in my opinion, and arguably the only thing we can do to travel long distances without emitting huge amounts of green house gases. I truly think that our best option is to try and find a new source of fuel for our airplanes. For example, is it possible that we take all of our vegetable waste products and convert it into vegetable oil for fuel? This will have to happen in the near future. There are so many people capable of figuring out solutions to this crisis. There are also many of us who cannot figure things like this out, but what we can do is take the steps to reduce our footprint immediately just as Ken suggested.

I have mixed feelings about some of the solutions Ken proposes in his lecture. The plane subject was brought up when he mentioned a carbon tax. This carbon tax would increase the price of flights and therefore less will be demanded. I, however, grew up always dreaming of traveling the world. I don’t agree with Ken that the price of flights should go up, as they are already expensive. A price increase would only mean that the richest people would be able to fly and travel. Over the summer I flew to Paris and Italy and enjoyed visiting those places greatly. It makes me upset to think that in 5 years, flight prices will be so high that I, as well as many others, will not be able to travel the world. When it comes to more domestic flights, I would also have to stick with my argument that flying shouldn’t be seen in such a negative light. I understand that planes have severe environmental impacts but I like visiting my family on the east coast. This must sound selfish but I know there must be some other people out there who enjoy visiting family or just going to vacation and use planes as their mode of transportation. Planes are convenient, cheaper, and time efficient than driving across the country.  The only arguments I can support are banning the use of private planes and limiting short distance flights for business or commercial reasons.

 <br><br>

Ken asked if we as individuals should act now or wait until we, as a whole, are going to act together. I think the right answer would be that individuals should begin doing what they think is best for them as well as the planet. I don’t think everyone will become vegan by tomorrow but maybe a couple people will. Maybe some people need meat in their diet so they will compromise to only eating it twice a week. In my opinion, as long as you are actively trying your best, within reason, to combat environmental issues, that is good enough. I just don’t believe it's fair to force everyone to live a life they don’t want to live. I understand we need to think about future generations and our planet but I think people should live a life worth living, whether that means flying to Spain or eating spaghetti and meatballs.

I'm struggling with Ken's statements regarding flying just as much as you are. In this video, Ken spent a good portion of the video addressing the professional complications abstaining from flying poses, but he completely failed to address the equally, if not more, important personal issues that choosing not to fly creates. On one hand, a carbon tax would be environmentally beneficial, keeping more planes on the ground and reducing the copious amounts of fuel consumption that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, flying is the only real practical way for someone to travel the world, particularly over long distances such as from one continent to another; I honestly don't see how so many people's desire to experience a variety of cultures can be satisfied without planes as a medium of travel. I mean, they're the only feasible way of efficiently traveling long distances; I don't think anyone wants to take a boat across the Pacific to reach somewhere like Japan or Korea in weeks. Until a viable alternative to planes is offered, I really don't see myself foregoing planes entirely; there are still so many places I want to visit, a sentiment that I think many people share. This isn't to say I'd be traveling frequently, say once a year, but I would like to go on weeklong or possibly longer trips to places like Denmark and Australia once every 3 to 4 years once I have the financial means to do so. I find there's great value in seeing how different parts of the world operate and how society differs depending on the country; simply put, it broadens one's worldview. I also feel selfish for saying this, but I just can't imagine limiting myself to North America for the rest of my life; I would go crazy staying in the same place for that long. There aren't very many domestic cities I'm interested in visiting in the first place. 

 <br><br>

I really agree with your approach to Ken's question as to whether a climate vanguard or individual change is more necessary/effective. Whatever each person can adopt to reduce their personal carbon footprint should be welcomed; obviously, the more action they take the better, but I'm not sure a lot of people can abide by most, if not all of the recommendations Ken has reiterated throughout this course: a plant-based diet, abstaining from flying, living in more eco-friendly housing, etc. Personally, since taking this course, I've been working to minimize my consumption of red meat and food waste as much as possible, opting to carpool instead of driving alone, and reducing the amount of stuff I have, and voting for legislation and politicians that support climate change solutions such as the Green New Deal, encouraging my friends and housemates to do so as well. Of course, I could be doing more, but I'm very much satisfied with the progress I've made so far; it made me realize that a good portion of the components of a greener lifestyle isn't very difficult to integrate into your own life.

As Ken mentions this is a one way path, we need to make changes now. Vote for legislators that support a carbon tax, would greatly affect the carbon emission. Such a tax will directly decrease carbon emissions and will lead big industries to alternative renewable resources. Although we can vote and hope for the best, our personal decision, can create a huge impact in our present and future. We can start by giving up the things that harm our planet. 
 <br><br>
We have learned that the food industry has and still is contributing for a large part of the CO2emissions in the entire world. The solution is to switch to plant based diets that will greatly decrease our carbon footprint. It is harder than it looks, but it can be done even if it is little by little. Despite the fact that we have grown within certain cultures, and certain cuisines, it is our personal decision to choose what we eat.  Thus once one has their own family, one can teach their kids better and educate others to a better diet and its impact on our planet. Since decades ago, Ken mentions the association between meat and wealth, which also affects the way people think about meat. We need to change these ideas that have shaped our cultures from generation to generation. “Anyone can begin working out the future of food in their kitchen today”, by reducing animal based diets, reducing food waste...
 <br><br>
Begin with what you eat today, not necessarily go vegan but reduce meat meals, this will result in a lower carbon footprint. I never thought about food labels with the product’s level of harm to the planet, but I think it is a great idea that will encourage people to switch to organic or plan based diets.  It is not easy, but the benefits outweigh the costs. We need the will to commit to make these changes.

I do believe that we need climate vanguards, someone needs to start because that’s how history has been made, we need to act NOW.

If people choose to wait until everyone else is on board, the process will take even longer than it already has. Also, if everyone waits until everyone else is "on board" no one will actually be on board in the first place. The climate crisis is undoubtedly an issue that needs to be treated with urgency. If people say they can't sacrifice something in their life to help combat climate change they are lying. I may not be able to change my omnivore diet to a vegan one very quickly or at all for that matter, but I know I can take on responsibilities like owning less stuff, having fewer children and taking public transportation more often than driving or flying. Looking at all the things we must do to successfully defeat the climate crisis is definitely intimidating, but the problem won't get any easier if we wait it out and do nothing. As a recently developed environmentalist, I have found that it is easier to start by making smaller changes that help the environment and progressively transition to ones that affect my lifestyle on a bigger level. Turning off appliances when they aren't being used and taking shorter showers are a couple easy ways to start slowly minimizing one's carbon footprint. I have really found the process of changing my lifestyle in favor of the environment as an enjoyable journey that I like increasingly along the way. Sure, I'm by no means a freegan or purely use my bicycle to get almost everywhere I travel, but stacking my personal efforts to reduce my carbon footprint makes me feel happier.

We need to act now because we can and should; we need to act now because if we don't start now, we will regret it later.

One thing I found very interesting in this lecture was the idea of "Americanizing" many different cultural cuisines by introducing a large amount of meat to the cultural diet. While America a is thought of as a melting pot of world cultures, each culture blended in is tainted by backwards American values and customs, much like this obsessive meat-centered diet. I myself am no exception, as I eat meat at practically every meal, and would struggle immensely with cutting out any type of meat from my diet. This just goes to show how ingrained these habits are in our society, and that we must bring about change soon, or it will never happen. As mentioned in the video about the Italian vs American Italian diet, and how much less carbon is emitted in the traditional diet, it would be interesting if a movement could arise in America surrounding the revival of traditional cuisines, without American influence. I personally would love to be able to try traditional cuisines from around the world, while at the same time reducing my carbon footprint, and I'm sure many others would as well. This idea of removing unhealthy American influences could be used in many other aspects of life aside from just food, such as adopting other cultural values that have worked for other countries that are more environmentally-conscious.
 <br><br>
I believe that we do need a climate "vanguard". Huge changes need to occur soon, and it is up to our generation to put the pressure upon elected officials as well as take it upon ourselves to "be the change we wish to see in the world."

The thought about "Americanizing" different cultural cuisines caught my attention too. Meat is a central part of our diets currently, and is a habit that will take a long time to recover from. I think there won't be any real change until laws are made, forcing people to make life choices that reduce carbon emissions. People are too comfortable in their current routines to completely alter their way of living, myself included, although I do try to do my part here and there. These life changes come without seeing an immediate result, and that is part of the reason not enough people are changing their habits. It is similar to the delay that caused businesses to keep their climate-damaging methods for the majority of the twentieth century, because they wouldn’t see an immediate change in the climate. I liked the idea of climate labels on food. I personally would love to know more about how much damage is done by the groceries I buy. It would make it much easier to chip away at an individual’s carbon footprint. For example, I was unaware of the fact that eating asparagus in the winter does a lot of damage. I think it’s an easily attainable task and could help a lot.
 <br><br>
            
I am beginning to feel bad about my own carbon emission. I grew up in a household that only ate white meat (chicken, turkey, and fish). My parents have only had white meat for the last 25-30 years. Although it does less damage to the environment, and I am happy about that, meat has still been the centerpiece for almost every meal I’ve ever eaten. I have thought about possibly eating vegetarian for some meals, and have done so a few times. I just feel like not enough people, like me, will make the effort to change.


<br><hr>
I agree with your observation with finding the idea of  “Americanizing” different cultural cuisines interesting. I found it very shocking, because as Ken said, with the example of Italian food, Italian food didn’t incorporate a lot of meat in their dishes until it was introduced in the United States. I also found it weird that, back then, incorporating meat into one’s meal was a sign of wealth. I can relate to you it comes to not incorporating meat into my diet. Meat is in almost every meal that I eat and when I try to not incorporate it, it tends to be a bit difficult for me, taking into account that that’s how my diet has been for all my life. I also agree with you that it would be interesting to see the revival of traditional cuisines without the influence of American culture (meat-intensive) on it. I’m sure if this were to happen, the rate of greenhouse gas emissions would decrease dramatically. This would not only be good for the planet, but for our health as well, taking into consideration that we wouldn’t be eating excessive amounts of meat. And as you said, I’m sure the we’ll be able to take something positive out of the various dishes for the plethora of cultures from all around the world that managed to do something positive with them. Just as you said, we can adopt other cultural values that worked for other countries that were more environmentally conscious. I agree with you and most of the class that we need a climate “vanguard” and spread awareness of the big changes we must enforce for the betterment of our planet and in turn our future. As you said, we should start off by placing pressure on elected officials to enforce these changes and take it upon our generation to “be the change we wish to see in the world.”

Ken started this video off by making a very strong and important point. Most people are not going to make the change on their own until they are forced to. Before this occurs, it is going to come down to a decision that every individual must answer on their own. Will you be part of the leading group that makes a voluntary change or will you sit and wait to be forced into making environmental choices. 
 <br><br>

One thing is very clear. A carbon tax is needed and we need to elect politicians that support this tax. However, although I tax, I disagree with the idea that it should gradually increase with time until eventually things like flying are not an option. Are we just supposed to never travel anywhere outside of the country anymore? Are we no longer allowed to visit other places and learn from others across the globe? Sure virtual meetings are one thing but you cannot virtually travel to australia that's just not the same. In addition, virtual meetings aren't the same as face to face meetings. Business is best conducted in a face to face setting and developing international partners doesn't just start with a random facetime to someone's phone. No. You have to travel to these places, make connections, and develop these bonds. Once the foundation is established then virtual meetings can be efficient. But they cannot exist on their own. Without the developed foundation, there is no way that virtual meetings can become an effective way to conduct business. Therefore fully eliminating planes would damage the business industry and the economy. With that being said, I still think that the idea of taxing carbon is a great idea. It will eliminate pointless plane rides and leave planes in operation for times of extreme need. In other words if it can be done without a plane then do so.  
 <br><br>

As a direct response to this video I think it is essential that we have a climate vanguard. It is true, the majority of the population will not make the change on their own. However, this is not because people are stubborn and will fight the change (although some will) but rather because most of the population is uneducated on this topic. The idea of what foods to eat at one time of the year is such a complicated concept and it is hard for people to follow this without someone promoting it. Like you said in the video, switching to a plant based diet will help but its still not as beneficial as eating meat sometimes. How are we supposed to know this? How are we supposed to know what to do? We can't make these changes without people leading the way.

I completely agree with your comment. I believe that a carbon tax is necessary for the world to reduce carbon emissions, especially large corporations that do not care about the environment. This tax is the change that is needed to force people to make the cultural change. I also agree with your point that taking the option of flying away completely is unrealistic. The point in traveling to a new place is to experience the world and all of its different culture, while some people need airplanes in order to see their families. A carbon tax is necessary to decrease the amount of unnecessary plane rides, but an increase in the tax is not needed because people will do whatever is necessary to experience the world. 

 <br><br>

I also feel that the label Denmark is developing is a great idea. People need to be educated about what they are eating and how the food is produced. Nowadays, is is extremely hard to know whether a company is telling the truth or lying about the food that they put out into the market. I also think that if there is a label saying that this particular product is hurting the environment, people will be less inclined to buy it. It is easy to buy something when you do not know everything about it, but when there are actual words staring you in the face saying you are making to wrong choice, people will buy less of that product. 
 <br><br>


In response to Ken's questions, I absolutely think that we need a climate vanguard. Social and political movements do start without someone to look up to as inspiration. Without someone to push the population to do better, we will never make the changes necessary to save the planet.

I have been wondering about one of the points Ken mentioned for a while, how can we justify the environmental benefits of plant based diets, when so often fresh fruits and vegetables require a huge carbon footprint to be transported to the US (since they are typically grown in tropical areas and have to be flown in). I think that a problem such as this could be resolved if people with largely plant-based diets tried to limit their consumption to locally grown fruits and vegetables, such as what can be found at a farmer’s market. For example, Ken said that it is environmentally disastrous to eat asparagus in the winter, instead I think that people could turn to local foods to avoid this problem. 
 <br><br>
In regards to Ken’s question as to whether or not we should wait for everyone to be on board with environmental changes, I don’t think we should. It would be irresponsible to wait for the government or anyone else to be on board and accept climate change, when the people who realize the severity of the situation should just act now. The idea of food labels that describe how bad a product is for the environment is a wonderful one. I would really like to know so that I would be able to make my meals from products with the smallest impact, and I’m sure many others feel the same way.

I think that since there are so many aspects that go into WHAT a person eats, it might be easier to focus on HOW MUCH they eat. So instead of focusing all our attention on plant-based diets, we should focus on food waste. For example, when Ken talked about the watermelon rind and the beet greens, I really thought about all of the parts of foods I throw away. I throw away citrus peels, banana peels, pineapple cores, carrot tops, onion skins, celery leaves, Swiss chard stems, cilantro stems, the extra milk after I've eaten my cereal, broccoli leaves, apple cores, mushroom stems, corn cobs and husks, and herb stems. All of these ingredients contain a lot of minerals; some even contain more vitamins than the rest of the already-eaten food! They can be eaten by themselves or used in broths, soups, chilies, or for added flavor in any entree! By eating these parts, we produce less garbage and we fill ourselves up more easily! Therefore, we can satisfy our appetites without consuming more than we need.

<br><hr>
I would like to say that it is inevitable that fresh fruits and vegetables are imported into US for now. But in total when we discuss the possibility, US is actually an agricultural export nation, meaning that it is producing more than it can consume. Therefore, it is entirely possible for US to rely on local(domestic) production of vegetables. Of course, for people in Utah desserts, their food may at least have certain footprint. Yeah, I agree to act now about environmental change, but from my own experiences, this gonna be really hard. Not to mention the bad food labeled VGN in our schools cafeterias. As a vanguard, one can lose a lot of things: immature cooking method of vegetables, regarded as eccentrics by people surrounding. We can be the brave explorers, of course. But I cannot stop thinking whether the day will be coming that all or most of the people get rid of meat diet, or we just have fewer people to enjoy similar menus of food. Observation leans to the second option, which is really sad. I may be fatalism, and I may be a vegetarian, but does that do much to environmental protection? I dare not to think.
<br><hr>
I agree, I think that focusing on how much we eat instead of what we eat is important to think about especially when it comes to food waste. Even if we switch to more plant based diets, wasting food causes just as much harm to the environment as wasting animal products. There are so many parts of food that are wasted and don’t even make it to markets and the dinner tables around the world. I like that you included how we can use bits of food that are normally thrown away in various meals. This idea of how to repurpose food that would be usually thrown to the side benefits not only the planet, but also the human body. Regarding Ken’s question as to whether we need a climate vanguard or if we should wait for everyone to be on board, I think that we should not wait for others. There are so many ways that we can make a change immediately, so why wait for other people when we can take action now? Like Ken, we can take action ourselves without having to wait for others; since coming to school, I have become vegetarian not only to reduce carbon emissions, but also for health reasons, have become more mindful of my waste of food, and take the bus/train home for break.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. As you mentioned, the carbon footprint cost by food transportation is actually a lot. I think people should only eat what they plant locally. I am a vegetarian. Some of my friends think eating vegetables is not satisfying enough, but actually, I think all the foods can be delicious as long as we think about how to make and treasure the food.  Some rich people living inland area spent a lot of only on air-transportation seafood, which is too luxurious and wasteful. Rich people are generally older because they accumulate their wealth for years. These people do not pay enough attention to the environment, and even some of them think this is the problem of their afterlife. We should be responsible for our future, and it is necessary to take action right now.
<br><hr>
I agree we cannot think of vegetables and fruit as being sustainable when it is shipped across the country. It is crazy to realize the huge amount of emissions that go into transporting “fresh” food across the country. I also think a reason why this is an issue is because many people who want to be vegan follow vegan influencers. Most of these influencers live in tropical places where they get their food locally. But for the average person who wants to recreate the recipient must get it from the store where it has been shipped. I agree that many people should shop at farmers markets to be more sustainable. Although there can be some issues with farmers markets. For example sometimes the food is more expensive and harder for people to be able to afford. Another issue I had no idea existed is some places do not have farmers markets. For example when I was speaking to my friend about this she said that where she lives in Florida there are no farmers markets close to her. 
 <br><br>

I agree we should not wait for the rest of society to start making changes. I think if we understand the way we are doing harm we should take inchiative and change our lifestyles now. I think that labels stating how many a food was to produce in terms of our environment is really smart. But I also think we would need a lot of regulations around this so that companies could not lie about the sustainability of a product. I think it would be really interesting to see how large of an impact a product has on the environment.

We are doomed to repeat the sins of our forefathers by consuming as much as they did with little regard for the environment. maybe not 'we' as the members of this class but we of Gen Z. We grew up with consumerism and we all participate in it. Look at the rise of Amazon and online retail, we want more and worse yet, we want it convenient no matter the cost. The meteoric rise of these tech companies isn't an accident we are doing the exact same thing as previous generations only now some of us are aware of it. The climate is facing irreparable damage and we are too busy adopting and modifying the culture of consumerism to make it more deadly to take notice that we are digging the grave dug over the last 100 years and shoveling faster than ever before. We need to innovate our way out of this storm or we will go the way of the dinosaur.

In this video, Ken brings up the topic of political activism, and I think that is a great idea. I believe that everyone should use their voice and make sure that it gets heard. I think that social media today helps with that, and that people who use their platform in order to spread their message is extremely powerful and it displays how we have control over what we believe. We have seen great movements, especially by young students. A great example is David Hogg and the Parkland students who are trying to combat climate change. From tragedy, they rose up and fought against the NRA, even on big stages, and use their voices in order to change politics. What is different about the NRA and climate change is that climate change is the world’s tragedy. 
 <br><br>


Yet, when we bring up politics, sometimes we forget the commonalities that bind us together as human beings. Someone could have the same values as you - family, career, friends, hobbies. But when we talk about politics, automatically, there is hatred towards the other person. It brings out the animosity in everyone. Why does that happen? Why do we allow politics to be so divisive? Yet, that is how our world is constructed. I, myself, refrain from talking about politics as much as I can because it pulls people apart when, instead, it should bring people closer together. But the way that our political establishment is set-up today, and how the two-party system makes us hate one another, truly gets in the way of getting anything done. Our hatred for the other party is stronger than our desire to make real change. 

 <br><br>

This goes the same for climate change. Because it has become a political issue, we become so divisive about our opinion, and the other party desperately wants to stop the other one, when in reality, they need to work together in order to create real change. We often confuse real issues with political ones. Real issues affect everyone. Climate change is no different. Let’s take the politics out of this issue, because it is obvious that politics has nothing to do with our future.

I agree with you that we all need to put our differences aside to enact any real kind of change. People forget that planet Earth is a shared space,  our egos are not as important as saving the planet. However, I have to disagree with you on your statement about politics and climate change not being intersected. There are many powerful individuals out there who hold strong political power, and because of this, they have the means to enact laws to prevent climate change if they wanted to. These powerful individuals often don't believe in climate change so they are able to implement laws that contribute to global climate change-- hence why politics are so deeply intertwined in global climate change. Politics is an important factor in reversing climate change because we have the power to elect those who care about the planet into office.  In an ideal world, we'd be able to take the politics out of the issue, but realistically it is a struggle that will always be present. Hopefully in the future people will open their eyes and realize that the issue doesn't lie between who's winning and who's losing, but rather, how we can collectively come together to save the Earth.

We should begin now! It’s all about personal choices. Why wait til everyone else is on board?? Everything that Ken covered here was very convincing and true. It comes down to not being a vegan or vegetarian, but being a Climatarian, no matter what anyone else thinks... because at the end of the day, what does it matter what other people think??

My boyfriend decided to turn to a pescatarian diet starting his senior year of high school. When I asked why he chose to do so, he explained that he was not necessarily motivated by a desire to reduce his carbon footprint, but he saw it as more of an ethical and health problem. So, whenever we go out for food, I always consider what he can eat and often end up eating similar foods myself. I even made the choice to cut my meat consumption for at least one day every week. I quickly found that there are a lot of vegetarian/vegan options out there and it is indeed possible to maintain at the very least a largely plant-based diet. 
 <br><br>


After watching Ken’s lecture focusing on food, I realized that his idea of being climate vanguards, or architects of the future for a healthier planet, is an individual choice that can occur for many reasons. As Ken points out, diversity in culture and values in the U.S. contribute to a person’s choices, including the consideration of the many benefits to switching to a more plant-based diet that do not have to do with mitigating the climate crisis, and my boyfriend’s decision shows exactly that. Ultimately, we can apply this to any environmental issue; the climate crisis is a dilemma on many fronts that requires the cooperation of all disciplines to solve the most difficult problems, but it is these personal practices and decisions, no matter how small, that begin to make a difference. So, to answer Ken’s question, I think that a climate vanguard is already forming out of individual choices and for reasons that are not necessarily to address the climate crisis but many other major issues today.

I agree. I think that people are becoming more and more aware of their diet and lifestyle choices and that this is what will make a big difference. I think that a large problem was, and unfortunately still is though not as much, that people live in, and are happy to live in, ignorance. People don't want to think about what they're and whether or not it's sustainable, they just want the easiest and tastiest option. However, we no longer have that luxury. Whether it be, like in the case of your boyfriend, for moral or health reasons or for environmental reasons, people need to realize that the food they consume has a profound impact on the environment and if that's not reason enough, that it has a profound impact on their health. I also agree with your statement that the vanguard can come in the form of people making better day to day decisions, but I don't think that it will be enough. I think that while it will do a great deal for people to make lifestyle adjustments, I think there need to be prominent voices and leaders, such as Greta Thunberg, who lead people in seeing the impact of their decisions and act as catalysts for a movement.


<br><hr>
The same thing happened to me subconsciously with my diet. I didn't plan to cut the amount of beef and chicken that I ate, but as the months have gone on I have realized how much healthier it is to eat vegetables and not eat as much animal products. Not to mention how much flavor and how filling this diet can be. I still consume meat and some other animal products but not nearly at the scale that I used to. And especially after taking English 22 and now 23 with Ken I have realized how big of a change I can help create with my diet alone and educating others on the climate crisis and ways they can help reduce their carbon footprint.

After watching Ken’s lecture I definitely think we need to act now. It is very easy to become comfortable with a certain lifestyle even if you know how badly it affects the planet. It honestly amazed me how much food is wasted just because it did not fit a certain criteria of how they are supposed to look, no matter that the food was perfectly consumable. I know personally I do not think about where my produce is coming from everytime I go shopping. Hearing Ken say that even if you eat either a vegetarian diet or a vegan diet if you buy asparagus in winter it is still bad for the planet because they have to transport them through planes which expel so much carbon directly into the atmosphere. 
 <br><br>
I think by starting now we could start setting an example for other generations and perhaps start implementing new ideas with petitions or electing political leaders that will do something about the climate crisis. By waiting we are just extending the damage that is already occurring just for future generations to start doing what we could start now.

Yes, we should act. However, we are not able to be the Climate Vanguard since some countries were already starting making change, while we are still at the point of questioning climate change. As the video said, Denmark has a climate label on every food. Looking at us, we are still “controlled” by large companies.

 <br><br>

I ate meat for every meal and didn’t like vegetables at all. So I might disagree with your idea that it is so easy to change the diet to vegan after you know how food affects the planet. I do feel guilty after seeing the film and the lecture video, and I do want to make a change in my diet. But it is a huge step to reach the target. I believe there are people who have the same diet like me, and even though they know the harmfulness of beef, they just can’t give it up. 
 <br><br>


Everyone has different thoughts on one thing. Back to Ken’s last question in the video, we need to act now, not because we want to be the Climate Vanguard, but we want to express our standing of climate change. The world right now has 233 countries, 7 billion people, we can’t wait until everyone agrees to action.


<br><hr>
I agree a lot with you, I think as a people we talk a lot about climate change and trying to fix it, but I don't see any action coming out of it. I constantly see people talking about fixing the climate and marching for it, but I can't help to think if every person there is actually making personal change are they just there to say they went to a climate change march.

Climate Vanguard was something that has never came to mind but the more Ken begins to dive into this concept the more it ever becomes more and more appealing especially in it's ability of bringing the grand topic of Climate Change to the people around the world by going where it matters, their wallets and lives. The issue with the people of the United States is the fact that we are unresponsive when issues in a global scale are affecting us until the threat is right in our own face. Even in our own home town of Santa Barbara, the birth place of the environmental movement in the United States, didn't become aware of the damages we are putting on the planet and the atmosphere until the oil from the offshore rigs began washing up on our beautiful shores in 1969, which affected the lives of many Santa Barbarians who all share their lives in the sands that lie on our coast. 
 <br><br>
That's where I see the appeal of the ideas put forward here by Ken because, ideas such as the carbon tax that would reduce the amount of need for travel and attack major carbon emitters like airliners we have went over in the very last week. The more money it'll cost for travelling will make the public and world ever so more aware of the climate crisis because of the fact that they will be thinking more and more about how much they spend. This also could have the ability to raise the overall use of public transports and biking which would in turn make the nation spend more on these modes of transports, and have civic areas that resemble what we see in cities like Copenhagen where more and more people are biking around than driving to work. 
 <br><br>
However, these changes can't truly take place until our generation becomes the generation to lead the nations around the world where we can share our knowledge of the past and shed them on the future for a ever so greener planet all around. In many ways, we can rewrite the American culture and American dream of our nation into a more Eco-efficient culture of thought and as the leading figure of the world, it could be shed everywhere else as we have seen many nations following our false and ever so damaging nature we have created around our culture called the "American Dream" which has been enriched in the world for years now. But we the people, can be the change for a greener and cleaner future here on our green planet.

I read your comment and I wanted to say how I totally agree with you when you say that the United States is totally unresponsive to the threat of climate change. Well, perhaps not 100% entirely, but I am of the opinion that we are definitely not doing nearly as much as we could and we should to be combating the climate catastrophe. I mean, we have many elected officials throughout the nation even in some of the highest offices of government who believe that climate change is a hoax! Despite us being supposedly the richest and greatest nation in the history of the world, we are not doing even close to what we could potentially accomplish if the United States decided to tackle climate change head-on. It’s ironic, and it’s why I am a big supporter of the Green New Deal and many politicians who are proponents of it. 
 <br><br>

Like you, I find a lot of appeal in a lot of Ken’s proposals, but the most prominent one for me is the carbon tax. I honestly think it would be such an effective way of curbing a lot of problematic sources of greenhouse gas emissions, notably airplanes just as Ken noted before. But you are right when you say that all of these proposed changes and plans cannot be implemented until our generation takes power. That’s why I believe that this year’s presidential election will be so incredibly important for the future of our nation, as well as the world. In my opinion, we have a true shot this year at electing a new administration who will take the climate catastrophe seriously and devote the resources necessary to lead the global fight against it. Carbon taxes, taking on corrupt industries and corporations, leading international efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions: all of these have huge potential, but it won’t be realized until we can have leaders of our nation - again, supposedly the greatest in the world - who see the problem for what it is and have the guts to do what is right.

In this lecture video Ken discusses the most tragic part of the climate crisis yet, that most Americans will not make the necessary changes to adequately combat the climate crisis unless they are required to do so. The main solution Ken gave in his lecture is to vote and elect people who will implement a carbon tax on all products and services requiring some type of greenhouse gas emission, therefore people will stop consuming products and services which release significants amounts of carbon such as air travel. Individual decisions people make such as deciding to stop traveling would severely impact people’s personal and professional lives.  Different ways of approaching our daily lives will be needed such as travel free conferences to significantly reduce individual carbon footprints. I believe many people are reluctant to elect politicians who will implement carbon taxes and other drastic measures because most people are more worried about savings and being able to do what they want to do without having to pay more money more than they care about the future of our planet. As cowspiracy and project drawdown both suggested, changing our diet to a largely plant based diet is one of the easiest and quickest ways to significantly reduce our carbon emissions, if we waste less food, switch our diets and make better use of land we can reduce our carbon emissions by 151.54 gigatons, a huge portion of our global emissions. The question remains, will the majority of people be willing to change their lifestyles in order to achieve this goal?

Having a carbon tax is a step in the right direction. I for one don’t think people will realize soon enough the impact they have on the environment. As complex and intelligent as the human race is, we will always have one major fault - our tendency to individualism and selfishness. I’d be a hypocrite if I said I have always cared about the well being of others before mine and my families. Why should I place more value on someone I don’t know or care for? Why should I be concerned about the well being of a person who has no concern for mine? Unfortunately I think a lot of people think like this, and it's upsetting when we are confronted with a crisis like climate change. How do we expect to save this planet when we can’t even save ourselves from being greedy beings who place no value on things outside of our individual lives. 
 <br><br>
If I'm to be completely honest, I do not have high hopes when it comes to people changing their lives on their own accord. There needs to be a system put in place with rules and regulations that will either encourage or force people to live more sustainably. And even though it is completely unfair, my generation will have to pay the consequences for the previous generations irresponsibility.

I definitely agree with Ken’s opinion that we should take the leading position as a climate vanguard, straightly facing the future situations. I appreciate Ken as a climate vanguard as he mentions his online conference model instead of traditional conference model, which case more carbon footprint because of air travel. That is opposite to the goals of these academic conferences that want to solve the issue of climate crisis. Ken’s behavior shows an excellent example for me to think about how to be a bold person to take the formidable job of being the architect of the future.
 <br><br>

    Ken’s lecture also demonstrates his critical thinking considering how our food choice influence the climate crisis. Although plant-based diet is a wise choice basically, we still need to ponder over other aspects that are related to food-production time period, transportation methods, import or export, and processing methods. For example, if we choose a vegan dish that contains imported ingredient travelled through airplane and requires processing methods that produce lots of greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, we should take immediate action to avoid food waste, which is direct and effective to mitigate climate crisis. This could also bring other external benefit such as reducing starvation in underdeveloped areas.

Personally, I believe that we should start taking action now rather than waiting around for the rest of the world to address the climate crisis. I believe the saying "monkey see, monkey do" pretty much sums up why I feel this way. This year I live with a bunch of people who are either vegan or vegetarian either for animal rights or environmental reasons. Since living with them I have found that my diet has included much less meat and diary products than it used to. In the beginning, a part of me felt guilty for eating meat around them but now I find that I just automatically choose vegetarian/vegan options. Especially after taking this class, I have found myself eating less and less meat as I am now fully aware of the environmental impact that meat consumption and production has on the planet. My point is, those who have chosen to stop eating meat and have began taking action in the fight against climate change have greatly impacted me and my part in the fight as well. If more people begin making little changes to their lifestyle for environmental reasons and start spreading awareness, I believe that others will too.

If we were really trying to be "architects of the future" as Ken states in his lecture video, then taking action now is extremely important because the effects of our actions probably won't be realized until decades later. I am in the same situation as you where more and more of my friends and the people around me are switching to plant-based diets such as veganism. I never really grasped just how impactful a simple change in one's diet could be to fighting the climate crisis, but after taking this class I now understand why more people are avoiding meat. Personally, it will be hard for me to completely get rid of meat in my diet because I have grown up with it without ever putting much thought into it. However, I can say that I have greatly reduced the amount of beef that I consume and am currently attempting to trend toward a plant-based diet, since I believe this is the most impactful thing any individual can do to mitigate the climate crisis.

Ken mentioned that we should put carbon tax in many fossil industries, and this might directly function as more companies become greener. Carbon tax can reduce pollution caused by factories  but not from individuals' consumption. In the last film Cowspiracy, I realized that more people should focus on our food lifestyle. We can eat beef or pork, but we should try our best to reduce greenhouse gas from cows. We can not waste beef and other meat products. When we waste meat products, we cannot imagine how much greenhouse gas is produced in the beef production assembly. Milk products are the most common things in our life, but we can always see the waste of milk. Endless milk waste stimulates the milk factories to raise more cows. Just in a animal farm, tons of greenhouse can be produced per day. However, there are billions of animal farms in the world, this is really a horrible data. This happens around us, but few of us pay attention to it. We overlook at other aspects like factories.
 <br><br>
Ken also mentions air travel. I think we can avoid air travels like some short flights. The governments also need to aid the airlines and aircraft companies like boeing and Airbus to develop low carbon emission plane. Boeing company has already started to develop such programs. They have many green test planes, so I think air travel carbon emission problems can be solved finally.
 <br><br>
Having a healthy and green lifestyle is really important. Stop wasting your milk in the glass now.

As Ken phrases it, I would like to be an "architect of the future," but there are some things I'm not ready to start doing. Personally, I'm not ready to commit to giving up flying yet because I have family overseas. I went to Egypt this summer for the first time since I was 7 years old and getting to spend time with my extended family and speak my first language in a cultural setting which I had mostly only heard of or experienced as a small bubble in contrast to Western culture was far too valuable an experience for me to commit to never having it again. I find it difficult to justify this to myself, but I feel that with most things we can do greener, there are often other moral or emotional benefits to doing them that way. For instance, thrifting is great because it cuts out the child labor in fast fashion, and eating plant-based feels good because I'm ALSO passionate about animal rights. In contrast, there is no emotionally valuable side-effect of cutting out flying, and it conflicts with my own familial and cultural values. 
 <br><br>
Additionally, on the topic of greener diets, I actually attended a lecture by Christopher Gavigan (a UCSB alum who cofounded the Honest company, mostly known for their bottles of tea but also has other products) that  who mentioned that he floated the idea of climate impact labels to his team, but they rejected the idea because something like only 2% of consumers would heavily value them in their purchases. Personally, I think the impact labels would be really cool, but I understand that the effort that goes into calculating that stuff and producing the label would drive up the prices of things with the label on them, thus making lower-impact products less affordable. I would much prefer to do my own research, especially since based off of Gavigan's company's, such a small proportion of people would consider these labels when making a purchase that it wouldn't be financially viable.

I too cannot be 100% an architect of the future seeing as I also cannot avoid flying. I too have family overseas that I will have to fly to visit. I am however open to paying a carbon tax for the flights I take. I am also open to slow travel but sometimes I don’t have the time for it. Now in regards to food, like Ken pointed out the food we eat is largely influenced by our culture. In my culture meat is a very big part of it and it’s hard to avoid when it’s involved in all our food. However, I have spoken to my mom and we have chosen one day a week to no longer consume meat. Like Ken mentioned, food waste is a big problem and I am proud to say that my workplace never lets food go to waste and it’s always composted. The nutritional label on how sustainable food is a great idea to be more self aware. However, like Hagar mentions it may drive up the prices of those foods making it more inaccessible to lower income households. I feel like we do need to act now because we don’t have time to wait around for everyone to catch up but we also have to admit that it will not be easy to enact all these changes and maybe even impossible.
<br><hr>
your comment brought up a few points that I can relate to based on your experiences with having family abroad and attending Christopher Gavigan’s lecture. I too wish that I could be an “architect of the future” and as of now, my life isn't all too detrimental to the environment (in comparison to the average American) as I bike everywhere I need to go, use a minimal amount of single use plastics, avidly recycle, have a closet of mainly thrifted clothing, rarely consume meat, and advocate for environmental stewardship everywhere I go. However, having family abroad and growing up in a diverse environment that fostered my curiosity for other cultures makes it difficult for me to say that I’ll never fly again or pass up opportunities to travel abroad. It was so easy for me to switch to the sustainable practices I mentioned before because the emotional upliftment from doing so outweighs any benefit from not. I know that we aren’t alone in this sentiment either. It’d be hard to find anyone willing to give up a trip to Paris or Bali for the emotional satisfaction of knowing they'd just be lowering their carbon footprint. 

 <br><br>

I too believe that in terms of food or household items, a label displaying the climate impact of the product would be a beneficial marketing tactic. Sparing an extra 50 cents to a dollar on a dish soap or laundry detergent that lacks the same harsh chemicals, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions to produce in comparison to other products would be enough of a benefit to persuade me to buy it. This is already the case with other labels such as “organic” or “all-natural.” As our generation continues to look for ways to improve the environment, I expect the 2% statistic you mentioned to rise as we increasingly gain the consumer power to vote with our money.

I think Ken's mention of how abstaining from eating meat has significant cultural implications brings up an important discussion of how the debate over prioritizing climate action strikes at people's core philosophical differences regarding the nature of life. When I first heard this section of the lecture I began to think about the religious implications of cutting meat out of people's diets. For instance, I can name many religious holidays in which the consumption of meat is normally considered a key part of. Then, my consideration of religious traditions made me begin to question how traditional religious beliefs regarding the nature of life and our world shapes how people view climate change and the moral questions regarding actions such as eating meat. Ken's basic argument against eating meat is that the less meat we consume, the less greenhouse gas emissions we cause, and in turn, we cultivate a more sustainable environment. This makes complete logical sense, and the science is clear that reducing our meat consumption is one of the primary ways to combat climate change. But then, in order to understand the religious factors impacting people's decision making on issues such as this, I researched instances in the Bible where the consumption is mentioned. While there are many verses on this issue, I think Genesis 9:3 sums up the majority of statements on this issue, stating that "every moving thing that lives shall be food for you." While I think it would be a stretch to say that this commends people to eat meat, I think it does represent the viewpoint that the earth and its natural resources were put here for the consumption of humans, a viewpoint that is not necessarily conducive to motivating people to alter their life to help the environment. Also, I think some religious beliefs regarding the end of time cause some adherents to discount narratives regarding the end of human life as we know it, since such predictions about the future and the end of the world are fundamental parts of their faith. My exploration of these questions is not meant to be judgemental in any way, I only believe that exploring these different viewpoints helps us understand how people who disagree approach these issues.

I am a big fan of the climate label idea. I had never heard of that possibility until Ken mentioned it in this video, and it is a great idea. If there were labels on all our food showing what was sustainable to buy and what is detrimental to the environment, I think a lot of people would stop buying the bad products. I can imagine there would even be a stigma socially around people who bought a lot of goods that were labeled as harmful to the environment. It might even get looked down on to the point that people stop buying them completely, and stores may stop stocking products that are harmful that season, which would benefit the environment greatly.

 <br><br>

I was also intrigued by hearing how food waste is just as bad and even a little worse than eating non plant based. I wasn't even thinking about how we waste a lot of plants like beets where no one eats the leaves. I think that there should be a way to educate people on how to get the most out of their food, and give a place for people to share recipes using all parts of food to get more people to stop wasting.
 <br><br>

Now that I know just how bad the food waste problem is, I will be more vigilant when I am eating to not get more food than I can eat. I eat at a dining commons the majority of the time, and the amount of food waste there must be horrific, as people often grab way more than they need and end up sending it to the trash. 
 <br><br>
There are some good ways to counter this as seen in some buffet restaurants where the food is paid for all you can eat, and if you don't finish a plate, you have to pay for that plate too. This forces people to not grab more than they can finish and waste food.

I also think that having a climate label is a great idea, and I had never heard about it before watching this lecture either. It may sound harsh, but shaming people is the way to go with taking the next steps to making change. I shame myself now that I know all of the horrendous effects of my actions, so even if I’m craving a burger I know that if I start eating it I will only feel guilty, so I choose something else. 
 <br><br>

I’ve been raised to eat everything I serve myself, so I’ve always hated food waste. I’ve mentioned this in a previous comment but I used to be the human garbage can in middle school because some of my friends would show up with perfectly packed lunches, and would throw an entire sandwich away, or throw all their fruit away just because they didn’t want it; so I started eating all their unwanted food. I also recently wrote an article for the Daily Nexus on how to reduce food waste by eating unknown edible foods (which was a workshop organized by Health and Wellness) and I learned about so many parts of fruits and veggies that we can eat but throw away. For example you can fry banana peels (but try to use organic) and make banana “bacon” which actually tastes like plantain chips, and you can eat strawberry stems whole or carrot tops by adding them to salad or sauteing them in oil. I think it’s important to spread this knowledge and spread the need to stop wasting food. 
 <br><br>

I think that buffet idea is extremely smart, because people always over order or over grab food at the dining halls. I can imagine the outrage already, but that is actually a very idea to reduce food waste on campus.

I think when we consider our diets and are urged to reevaluate/confront the way we eat, it is very easy for people to put a wall up and ignore the reality of the situation for a number of reasons. I think that cultural significance and upbringing play a significant role in this phenomena; however, I think the chief issue in convincing Americans to change their diet is their sense of entitlement. We have reached a point in American society, where, as Ken said, meat is “what’s for dinner.” Baby Boomers and Gen X have been raised in an era where eating meat was a display of status, a luxury, and not a right. But over time, we have expanded the meat consumption in the country dramatically to the extent that now most people across a variety of social classes have animal products and protein at the dinner table. So it is not surprising to me that previous generations, as well as a significant portion of our generation would resist giving up meat, a product that they believe it is their RIGHT to consume. For this reason, choosing to wait for the vast majority of the American public to get on board could have devastating consequences, as this would likely be an extremely long term project with no real change in the immediate future, which is something we simply cannot afford to allow. As a result, this responsibility will fall to those of us willing to make these changes in our own lives and demonstrate/set the stage for a mass transition away from eating meat. 

 <br><br>

I also want to acknowledge that my own personal vegan diet (for the last year) has been less than perfect, containing a variety of processed meat and dairy substitutes marketed to us by the same major brands that manage and control the entire meat/dairy industry. It has become increasingly impossible to consume vegan substitutes sustainably, which makes the complexity of this major issue all the more evident. What our dire situation truly calls for is a focus on the consumption of unprocessed, whole foods. For example, instead of making the Annie’s boxed vegan mac n cheese this week for dinner, I made a cauliflower, potato and lentil pasta mac n cheese from scratch in mass. Changes like this may seem insignificant but if you look at the breakdown, my food waste is significantly less when using unprocessed whole vegetables. None of the items in this recipe are packaged in any kind of plastic or wasteful material, and significantly fewer emissions went in to the meal overall simply because I used bulk whole foods and veggies from the co-op. Since making changes like this, my parents have noticed the positive effects on my health and the planet and are now eating vegan 80% of the time, something I thought I would never be able to say. And its not just my parents. All the time people ask me for helping making the transition away from animal product consumption to a plant based diet, a clear sign that there is legitimate interest and motivation to change. 
 <br><br>


That said, simply waiting for society to catch up will not be enough. My own experience over the last year of my vegan diet has taught me that if you make the vegan options accessible, reasonably priced, and popular among the public, people will start to catch on. But simply hoping that will happen fast enough to meet the demands of the planet is naive and a risk that we cannot afford to take if we want this planet and the people on it to have a livable future.

To answer Ken’s essential question, I think we should start acting now. The good part is, that I think we have. Realizations that will eventually make strides in the right direction ARE in fact being made. I think if people just watched more documentaries and read a few more articles online, mindsets would already start to be shifted. After all, that’s all we can do, it try to influence people’s decisions. We cannot act for them, but can give them all the evidence they need to make their own decisions. I think the climate labels on food idea is really cool, and I hope America can be as willing to start introducing these onto food labels soon. An idea I just wanted to throw out there is that I think niche Vegan/Vegetarian restaurants that are seen as “cool” and a must try are the future of changing what people consider status when it comes to food. If we can get some of the next chefs we know to start using vegan recipes and really wow us into wanting to eat less meat, I think the excitement and hype behind veganism would allow for more and more people to adopt this lifestyle. I think it’s time that we step away from the “look at how bad our earth will become” and stop treating these lifestyle changes as a chore, but start looking at them as “wow, this is exciting, new, healthy, and I truly feel and am better”. This mindset shift is just as important.

I definitely agree with your assertion that a vanguard already exists. Though small, there are a decent amount of people who are slowly adopting these ideas as lifestyle choices, from going vegan to quitting driving and flying. And I’m not sure if the rest of the world will join in until they see it as necessary AND cool. When the U.S. wanted homes to grow their own food during the war so there was enough food to send to soldiers, they made victory gardens cool. When they wanted women to work in the factories, they made Rosie the Riveter cool. If the U.S. made vegan diets and electric bicycles cool, it would be a done deal. Everyone and their grandma would hop on the wave.
<br><br>
The mindset shift is absolutely important. By providing people with the evidence of how important these changes are, we will start to see changes in the hearts of people who care about the future of their planet. Documentaries like Before the Flood and Cowspiracy can easily start internal dialogues about how one’s life choices are affecting the planet. Climate labels could be a great way to start. If people realize how much every item they eat affects the planet, it would be eye opening. I certainly don’t think about how much methane was released for every plate of KBBQ I order. Once environmental thoughts are unavoidable thoughts when we make choices, the climate crisis will take a turn for the better.


<br><hr>

I agree that we need to act now, why wait for the rest of society to catch up if our planet is dying. We have the information, resources and technology to make implement change now, so why wait? One of the many solutions that I feel very passionate about is the Climate Tax. I had previously learned about it when researching The Green New Deal and in Econ 1 last quarter. I found it very compelling that my moderately conservative professor fully advocated for a carbon tax, and demonstrated to the class that from an economic perspective, there are no downsides if the tax is done properly. Another solution that caught my attention was the idea of climate labels. This seems like a fantastic way to educate and inform consumers on the impact of what we buy, and this could go even beyond food. What if we used climate labels in the fashion industry as well. I personally know that if I was given the option to weigh the climate impacts of everything I buy against a more sustainable solution, I would choose the more environmentally conscious option, and I think others would do the same. Both the idea of a carbon tax and climate labels could be used as examples of how we can shift our mindset to embracing environmental solutions, and getting excited about making the world a better place.

I think an important part about this lecture is the idea of changing our diets and forms of consumption while also understanding the cultural context through which these practices even came to be. Without that context, we tend to assume the information ourselves and accept the status quo. Like Ken stated, Mediterranean cuisine traditionally centered around vegetables and oils and beef was introduced into it when the cuisine was brought into America. I was originally worried about where he was going to go with this point, but I respect that he only gave an answer for the culture that he belonged to and grew up in. 
<br><br>

So does a climate vanguard need to exist? Most likely. We need someone to voluntarily be brave enough to face the powerful elitist and profit-driven climate detractors; and whether voted into office or not, is able to properly educate the masses and work to make resources towards a solution more accessible and possible. This person has to be able to have some kind of vision of the future and educate. It does not matter what that future looks like, we just need someone unafraid to take action as an individual and earthly organism, rather than a politician counting on the funds of fossil fuel interests. They need to be focused on changing current unsustainable practices or at least work to make it a much more visible issue. Only then will a vanguard be effective.

I agree with you. I think we need a president that we can all follow and rely on with the climate issue. If the president supports it and tries to make a change so will other people. I definitely think a climate vanguard is necessary. I agree with your point that someone needs to be brave enough and face the elitist and the profit driven climate deniers. If this happens and they expose these people then the climate deniers will have no choice but to accept climate change. I agree that the only effective way to be vanguard is to be focused on the future for the next generations. I believe that if people realize the effects climate change has on the next generations because of the time lag that it will change their views on the climate crisis. I believe a climate vanguard is necessary to spread the message of climate change and to expose the profit driven companies and elitists.

<br><hr>
I like how you stated “We need someone to voluntarily be brave enough to face the powerful elitist and profit-driven climate detractors; and whether voted into office or not, is able to properly educate the masses and work to make resources towards a solution more accessible and possible”.  I think that a great way to explain the importance of a climate vanguard. I think there are so many people like myself that believe in the importance of climate change and the need to get everyone on board. I think the only way to do this is to have people that can dedicate their life to this mission. For me personally I would love to make that commitment but struggle to do so while at school and working. 
 
<br><br>

In regards to Kens question about what I think the future diet will look like. My genuine response is that I don’t know. In looking at all the new “meat” options that are going around I would say that’s where our future is headed. I don’t really know how I feel about this. Because I don’t think genetically modified lab made food is the answer to this problem. I would hope that more people would come on board with eating plant based as opposed to vegan junk food. But if vegan junk food is going to help people switch to a plant based diet then I guess that would be helpful.


<br><hr>
although I do understand where you're coming from with needing to find someone to face the elitist non-sustainable interest people I think we should follow the path of least resistance here. Corporations and economic markets have a whole different life of their own, seperate from their constituents (the people). The only way markets and corporations move is when the economy is directing them. So the best way to create a sustainable world is through innovation. We need cultural and spiritual innovation, to educate the masses and propose/provide a new way to view the world and our role in it, and a new way to live and consume. On the other hand we need an economy that incentivizes and rewards sustainable practices.
<br><br>

I think we are much more likely to solve this problem effectively if we work in this way. The people who you have mentioned will be forced to follow. I think already the smartest people are divesting from non-sustainable things and moving to a sustainable economy.

I think it is a little disingenuous to continue to esteem Denmark, and all Scandinavian countries for that matter, as the group that is at the forefront of solving climate change.  Yes, when it comes to personal changes these countries seem as if they are green, but when we look at deeper into their economy we see discrepancies.  First in the case of Denmark,  >10% of their exports are meat products or petroleum products.  In the case of Norway, the "green standard country",  nearly 70% of their Exports are petroleum and mining products.  Realistically, these countries could not support their green domestic initiatives without the extraordinary economic support they receive from exporting goods that directly harm the environment.  

<br><br>

On another note, I agree that we need to act now to change our world for the better.  Unlike others in the comments who want a socialist revolution, I think this can be done through the markets.  As millennials enter the age where they can ear enough to save and invest, and members of Gen Z are entering the workforce so we will have larger access to capital, we need begin partaking in investing in socially responsible portfolios, and supporting brands that are working to solve the climate crisis.  Ways you can invest in socially responsible portfolios(ESG's) is by going on The Vanguard (funny coincidence)  Group's website and search for ESG funds to invest in.  For brands you should support, Microsoft has plans to be carbon negative by 2030, and Patagonia is at the forefront of reducing clothing waste with many different programs.  We don't need to overhaul the system to make a big difference, we just need to make conscious choices that will significantly benefit our world.

Yes, I really agree with your opinion. There is no denying that we cannot continue to see Denmark and all Scandinavian countries as leading the way in addressing climate change. In the face of environmental problems, no one is not wrong, let alone a country. As the saying goes, no snowflake in an avalanche is right. Although it seems that those countries are green and environmentally friendly, without factories and pollution, they cannot develop in the current situation. In fact, relative to countries, I think individuals are the main power to change. As I remembered, people in the United States buy about 60 clothes per year. If people reduce their demand for clothes, those clothing companies will reduce their supply to earn the profit. In this process, although we cannot determine the policies in society, we can reduce our personal waste and demand to change the whole market supply. Moreover, as Ken mentioned in the video, the air tickets in the future will be more expensive since the carbon tax will increase. However, I think it is a good way to reduce air flights in order to reduce carbon dioxide in transportation. But on the other side, it will influence the economy in some ways since it will reduce the purchasing power of normal people.

Think about the first time you went to an amusement park. The roller coasters with vertical loops and corkscrews may have sounded frightening to you, but maybe not to your wild, thrill-seeking best friend who ended up dragging you on the rides with them. And before you knew it, roller coasters became your new favorite activity. If your friend had only attempted to tell you how amazing roller coasters were, you might not have been convinced that they’re as fun as your friend makes them to be. The fact that they were able to bring you on the ride with them is what swayed your opinion and actions, and the same goes for climate change.
<br><br>


The argument that climate change needs to be dealt with now is without a doubt compelling and urgent, yet the great majority of people are able to dismiss it and go on living their lives the way they are. But if a relatively small group of people begin shifting their lifestyles, and the right people (those in power and those with many followers) do too, it is much more likely that the rest of us will follow suit. 
<br><br>


So, yes, if it means that the cost of plane tickets will skyrocket and that we need to switch to plant-based diets, among the many other changes that must be done, we absolutely need a climate vanguard to pave the way.

I agree that we need a climate vanguard for 100% because it is an effective way to motivate others to join the actions in saving the Earth. It is human nature that we prefer not to be the first but follow the most to reduce the risk of being against and condemned. Looking back the history, many important revolutions were successful raise attention and get great progress after someone stand out and lead the others. As more and more people start doing one thing, soon the people around the world will follow. I believe one reason that all the actions to save the environment have less significant impact is because we lack a leader. Everyone has different ideas and do what they believe, so with all the disagreements, how can we make a big change? The solutions mentioned in articles and documentaries require everyone to being part of it, otherwise the change will be tiny. In fact, sometimes I feel weak or even doubt the usefulness when I choose not to drive or eat meat, because the outcome seems so tiny that the climate won't be better under the things I do. However, if people around me are all doing the same thing, I believe I will be more motivated and confident about what I am doing.

As the website shows, food waste ranks top 3 in Project Drawdown. This field has great potential to reduce our damage to earth. Since America is a country constituted mainly by immigrants, there are various kinds of diet. But the most common American-diet is terrible to our environment, which contains different kinds of meat. My school is a great example. I often go to two dining halls in our school: Ortega and De La Guerra. They both offered burgers, French fries, and salad at noon. According to my observation, burgers with French fries are the most common pairings for boys, while many girls prefer to choose salad. So such unhealthy American-diet is still popular among students. Moreover, these two dining halls usually serves roast chicken, beef, and pork. In fact, they are like two factories which produce huge amount of carbon footprint every day. It is very terrible. Luckily, Ortega has vegetarian day sometimes. However, dining halls do not hold vegetarian day frequently. But what is even worse is that students will choose other dining halls to eat meat. In my opinion, we should hold more vegetarian day in every dining hall at the same day in order to really protect our environment. But what is more important is the propaganda of healthy diet. Coercion is useless, so we should teach them and make them realize what is the correct choice. 
<br><br>
I am also interested in Ken's point about wasting less food. He mentioned sometimes we only eat part of the food, such as watermelon. This is true. For most of the fruit, we throw away the peel and core. To be honest, I do not have a clear idea about how we can consume food totally. Maybe we should properly handle food waste in new ways to make use of them efficiently. In this way, technology is very important.

<p>
We should definitely begin acting now, but it is also important and necessary for everyone to get on board. It would be great for us to have a climate vanguard as long as that can influence everyone to get on board. 

<br><br>

In this lecture, Ken focuses on another lifestyle change that must be made in order to combat the climate crisis. That lifestyle change discussed in this lecture is the american diet that relies heavily on meat and that leads to the waste of a lot of food. As Ken mentions, what we eat is a huge part of our culture. As a Latino, I was raised on eating dishes and meals that involve a lot of meat and other animal products. Everyone in my family is used to these meals and dishes because it is what we have had for our whole lives. This makes it extremely difficult for me to switch to a heavily plant based diet. It is difficult to switch to a diet that is contrary to the only meals that you are served at home. Now that I am living away from home and on campus, it is easier for me to switch my diet, but I have not done so. It is pretty difficult to alter something that has been part of your whole life, but I must push myself to do better. Regarding the waste of food, that is something I don’t have a problem with. I was always told by my parents to never throw away any food.

To respond to Ken’s question of whether or not we should start a climate vanguard, the answer is simple: it is of utmost importance to do so. I realize that it’s extremely difficult to take publicly take a stance that is 1) controversial 2) differing from the majority of the American population. The climate crisis is a far different matter because it’s not only an American issue, it’s also a global issue. Because we have not seen its direct effects on our daily lives, it’s much more difficult to be the first to publicly voice opinions. For those who do understand the evidence, and find it to be valid, now is the time to act. If not, everyone will continue to remain ignorant, leaving the crisis to worsen or even speed up rapidly. We may not see the direct effects now, but I can’t imagine how terrifying it would be when we do. I absolutely think changing lifestyles and moving more towards an environmentally friendly one will start a domino effect. Once it starts, then it’ll trickle down, possibly changing the culture of the global population.

I think one of the most important things that I do not see people talking about is the fact that restaurants/supermarkets are selling food with way too big of a portion. I grew up living in different Asian countries, and one thing I truly loved was the fact that the portions at restaurants or the vegetables/meat at supermarkets came in small portions. I see some people eating at restaurants and leaving half a plate full of food behind in America. Even if people pack up the leftovers, they most likely threw away some of it at home. When we go to restaurants, do we really eat that much food? Most of us leave leftovers, right? So why not make the portions smaller so that we don’t have to worry about wasting?
<br><br>
To people who have trouble transitioning to vegetarianism/veganism because they like the taste of meat too much, start with not wasting food. You don’t have to give up anything, but you are making a big difference. Not wasting food will not cost you anything.
<br><br>
Also, one more thing. I hate the idea of buffets - both restaurants and dining halls. People walk into the buffets having the mindset of eating as much as they can. However, they end up grabbing way more they can finish and end up wasting so much food. Why can’t our dining halls be charged for every dish we get? That way, people will actually think about whether or not they will eat it before grabbing it.

I believe that in a sense we do need a vanguard. If a group of people begins to live a certain lifestyle, in this case eating more environmentally friendly, the concept will spread and influence others to try the same. I do think that we should start adjusting our lifestyles now before it is absolutely necessary because it will be more of a gradual transition rather than going “cold turkey.” And like mentioned before, if people begin to adjust now, other people may catch on and adjust on their own which helps combat climate change as early as now. In this lecture, I was surprised by the fact that eating a plant such as an asparagus during the winter can be as environmentally detrimental as eating a piece of meat. I was relying on the notion that meat is environmentally bad but eating plants is good. However, I now see that eating a plant that is not locally grown can have just as a negative effect as eating meat because of its carbon footprint due to transportation. Therefore, I believe that labeling food with their carbon footprint is a great idea since I am sure there are others that may not consider the plant’s mileage.

I think the role of the architect for the future is one that everyone is born into. Regardless of our decisions and intentions, the future of the planet will be tremendously impacted. Through our daily actions, the environment can shape into a sustainable home for the entire population or an inhabitable wasteland. Therefore, architects of the future are not limited to those actively seeking to improve the planet because they’re not the only ones shaping the planet. Without environmentalists actively working and preserving, this planet is not at a stagnant state. Rather, the planet would be rapidly deteriorating unchecked. This is because the people who are not working to stopping climate change are working to accelerate it. Everyone is an architect for the future in that everyone has the responsibility to shape the future. If one decides on inaction, they’re still responsible and implicate for the future. They’re still architects for the future but it’s a future that’s hostile and tough. I think its therefore important to recognize that everyone, regardless of their decisions or actions, have an impact on this world. 
<br><br>
When I think of a climate vanguard, I don’t think of an architect for the future. As I said, an architect for the future applies to everyone. Climate Vanguard on the other hand is someone leading the way for the development of new ideas or movements. I think it’s vitally important for individuals to serve as examples so that others can be inspired to do the same.

I think the most highlighted part in this video is that the majority of people are not willing to take any action until our planet forced us to do so. It is somehow a true statement but may also cause a conflict. Ken also mentioned that going to a vegan could be an option but it would not be an effective choice. For example, he mentioned that eating asparagus during the winter time could have the same negative influence as eating meat like pork. In other words, vegetables could cause the same carbon footprint. So it is really the time for us to make some useful and helpful changes to our planet. It is our responsibility not just an individual.

I share your viewpoint that a big takeaway from this video, in my opinion, is the fact that many people won’t make critical lifestyle changes until they absolutely have to. I’ve been trying to explain to my parents the devastating impacts of some of the decisions they make for themselves and for our families, but the issue seems so far away from them that they refuse to accept that they need to change their ways. They don’t see why they should have to give up their luxury cars and the trips to Hawaii we take every year considering most of the rest of the population won’t be giving these things up either. The ironic thing to me is that once I’ve educated myself on the many topics covered in this class, I DO feel forced to make lifestyle changes. We don’t get an Earth #2. Every day that our population doesn’t make the changes that we need to make is another day that we are destroying our home.

Ken starts talking about how we need to elect officials who care about the environment, implementing carbon taxes. If a carbon tax was created, big fossil fuel companies would be taxed, and something like the price of plane tickets would increase. This would result in less plane tickets being bought, and less flights being flown. A carbon tax would be very beneficial for our country and the world, lowering the carbon footprint of many who would decide to fly a lot less due to the price. We currently have talked about air travel very frequently during this year, and personally I, and many others, are not as willing to give up flying totally, like Ken. But a carbon tax would significantly decrease mine, and I am assuming others want to fly, once again due to the price. But in order to fight this climate crisis we need to change many things in our day to day life, like travel, diet, and lifestyle. 
 <br><br>
The main topic within this lecture is food, cutting out meat and switching to a mostly plant based diet is one of the best things that one can do for the environment. Many are very hesitant to make this switch because of the culture we have grown up in. American diets are very meat centered and the meat is always the main part of the dish, also every meal in America has some sort of meat within it. Personally about two years ago I decided to switch to a vegetarian diet, to lower my own personal carbon footprint, and am in the process of becoming vegan. It wasn’t very difficult for me, because of the fact that my family was very accepting and accommodating towards my switch because they knew how passionate I am in the environment. My extended family gives me trouble for not eating meat, like saying things like “what do you eat?” in sarcastic and degrading tones; and always putting in their two cents how I am not making a big impact, because I am just one person or how am I getting my protein. This is very different from what happened to my best friend when she switched to a vegetarian diet. She comes from a family of big hunters and meat eaters and they just ridiculed her, and did not accommodate for her new diet. Switching to a largely plant based diet personally is not very hard, it is a simple lifestyle change, and if we make it more normalized and largely accepted around many different cultures. But there are also many new resources and plant based “meats' ' that give people the taste of meat for people who are hesitant to switch their diet. We need to normalize eating more plant based, eating more locally in order to help mitigate the climate crisis, and this will never happen unless we normalize these new diets.

 I too agree that I, along with many others, are somewhat unwilling to give up my ability to fly to any place in the world, but I too agree that a carbon tax increasing the price of plane tickets would also lower my want to travel. I feel that flying, every once in a while, would be okay as long as said person takes other cautions within their daily lives to lower their footprint and help the environment. Switching to a completely plant based diet, while not completely eco friendly, is more eco friendly than the entirety of the meat industry. I was shocked to hear that cuisines come to America and the meat industry swamps them, implementing meat into almost every cuisine there is in America. While I cannot say much as someone who devours meat in 2 seconds, I do believe that as a whole our world needs to make the switch to a more plant based diet, even removing the large amounts of meat used within the cuisines and using meat substitutes would be better than ridding of meat entirely. I do believe that we need a climate vanguard in order to lead to this world-wide change as the majority of the world will not accept veganism as a way of life due to the various cultures and traditions worldwide. While I too have needed some convincing as to why I need to switch to a more plant based diet, after the reading for this week and the videos provided by Ken I understand why the switch is crucial to the environment and why I too need to start the switch to a more green diet.
<br><br>
I believe that having a climate vanguard would not pressure the world to create changes, but would guide the world in the correct path as a way to facilitate change within all communities. Hearing that some countries are attempting to find ways to be completely carbon free, I was amazed and shocked that some cultures have the ability to understand the detrimental effects behind their actions and some, like ours neglect these facts. The utilization of postage on food items alerting the consumer of their carbon emission is genius and I believe that all countries should hop on this idea and implement it within their societies. We cannot wait for the world to understand the effects of their daily lives because if we do, there will be no place to recognize the consequences. Using a climate vanguard would guide people along to a change because our world does not do good when under pressure, so I believe that if we pushed climate change onto the world change would not occur, but guiding them along would generate significant change.
<br><hr>

I agree that if a carbon tax was implemented and the price of plane tickets increased, I would definitely be viewing air travel as one of my last priorities in terms of transportation. Making air travel less accommodating economically would definitely lower many carbon footprints.

Thank you for sharing your background on switching to a vegan diet. My family is quite the opposite. My parents love meat, with beef being their number one source of protein. Like you said, it is the American lifestyle. There is really no escape, because every restaurant you go, there will most likely be some sort of meat-based protein on the menu, and that is how it will be for generations onward. I am the only one in my family who has cut down on meat consumption, with my sister being very aware about her diet as well. However, it seems to be difficult for people of older generations to change/alter their diets due to religious reasons, or simply not being able to change their decade-long eating habits. I brought up religion because once I brought up some facts shown in the documentary Cowspiracy to my mother, she responded with "God made animals to be eaten." I grew up in a Christian household, and my mother is very strong in her faith. After thinking about what she said, I realized that there are many individuals on this planet that have the same mindset as her, which ultimately affect their decisions towards their diets as well. I am strong in my faith, and in my opinion, animals were created to live among us, and thrive in conjunction with humans. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments states "thou shalt not kill." Wouldn't this fall into the category of slaughterhouses? On top of that, there are  biblical verses that hint at a vegetarian lifestyle too. All in all, my point of this is to say that many people around the globe have certain beliefs that are cemented in their head for a variety of reasons, but these beliefs can be changed with substantial proof, and many people coming together and creating collective change. People like seeing the facts; once the facts are known, change occurs, and once change occurs, more people join such change. Then, certain ways of living begin to be normalized. This is not easy, nor is the goal of changing one's diet as simple as we think it is, but what we can do is bring attention to the consequences of livestock consumption towards as many people as we can around the globe.
<br><hr>
I felt like I was the only one in this class that felt this same way. I do not want to completely give up my ability to fly because I honestly that I love that luxury, however, I agree that if there was some sort of carbon tax that people would be much less inclined to fly and I think that businesses would also be much less inclined to set their employees as well. 
<br><br>
In response to the food, I agree that the American culture praises people who eat meat and eating meat makes people one of the economically elite. I also switched to a vegetarian diet and, I too get the comments from my family about not eating meat and I feel like it just needs to be something that becomes normalized as well. We are making great strides socially and I think that this is just one of those things that we need to implement into our daily lives.

I agree with you Jayce about how we need to implement a carbon tax, change the culture of our consumption and our eating habits. To answer Ken’s question I think we need to a climate Vanguard or nothing will change. Without this group of people leading the way and creating social change, we are doomed. People will be unwilling to change their habits and are naturally selfish. People will not vote for a carbon tax, I believe that millions of American’s would be outraged. Since we live in Santa Barbara, California we live in a bubble. I don’t see the “red” states voting to enact these laws and instill these changes and that is why we need a climate vanguard. We need to start today promoting a sustainable, healthy culture that doesn’t harm our planet. It is a movement and movements grow. We, including myself, need to start today by changing our eating habits. Thank you Jayce for sharing your story about your transition to vegetarianism. I haven’t seen my parents since the beginning of the quarter and I have told them how I am going vegetarian. At first they were surprised, and my mother too was worried about if I was eating enough protein. A couple of weeks have passed and they called me to tell me about their lifestyle changes. They are consuming less and no longer of plastic bags in the house. They also no longer eat red meat (a good place to start). I believe that this will work and hopefully overtime our society will change their habits.

As Ken said, our eating habits have largely to do with the culture we are born in. I’ve heard many people are reluctant to eat completely vegan because of cultural reasons and they would feel as though they are losing that intimate part of themselves. I’m Vietnamese and luckily, many traditional dishes are already vegetarian or just take a bit of tweaking to become a fully vegan dish and I can still feel like I am indulging in my heritage. I feel grateful that I can do this because I can still easily share meals with my family at home, but I can’t say that it’s easy for everyone and I totally understand why some people wouldn’t want to be vegan for that reason. The bright side is that all the planet needs is for everyone to try their best. Because of labels that entail specific requirements, I think people feel intimidated to put themselves into that category. I’ve had many friends say to me, “apart from the cheese that I eat sometimes, I’m completely vegan,” and I honestly think that’s great, but they don’t need to label themselves or put that extreme upon themselves. If you eat mostly plant-based and once in a while eat a traditional dish that has meat in it, that’s fine if that’s what’s realistic for you. I feel that if everyone can do the best that they can, it will make a huge difference rather than completely omitting plant-based foods because you eat meat sometimes. Personally, I feel my best eating vegan and I can completely cut out animal products including things like honey, so I do, but as I said, just do your best. 

<br><br>

I didn’t know about the climate labels that Denmark wants to establish, but I think it’s a great idea and should be required everywhere at this point. Eating not only plant-based but with the climate in mind like eating seasonally and locally could do a world of wonders for the climate. I hope that the US can get on board with introducing such climate labels.

 I totally agree with you at this point. As Ken stated, people's habits depend on the country they grow up. I was born and grew up in China. The eating habit in the north of China is mainly meat. I understand how hard it is for people to change their eating habits once it forms. Actually, being a vegan is one of the useful ways to reduce our environmental problems. There are many toxins in the meat, because an animal would produce many toxins before death. Eating meat can increase the rate of heart attacks and all kinds of cancer. Like I Have said before, animal agriculture is one of the biggest problems for our environment, they can produce tons of trash and feces that are barely possible to fully recycle on the earth. I've tried to be a vegan for 3 months in the past, I lost a lot of weight and I felt that my brain is working faster than usual. Everything seems different, because I start to shift my attention from food to other things in my life. First, I have to admit that eating only vegetables is a pain for me. But I have experienced something that I never experienced before.

I agree with what Ken said in this lecture and I believe that there should be more climate vanguards to help mitigate the severity of climate change. I think the idea of the carbon tax is good, but there might be several challenges and difficulties to deal with. Since carbon tax is proposed to encourage high-income individuals to reduce their carbon footprint, low-income individuals are producing CO2 as well and they may not eliminate the release of greenhouse gases fully which in this case, the carbon tax will increase their living burden. I think it is hard to make a balance about the carbon tax. Furthermore, although I totally support that air travel will bring a huge amounts of greenhouse gases released to the atmosphere, I don’t think people could get rid of airplanes one day. As an international student, I would fly at least one round-trip to my country, China where is far from the United States. So, it is hard for me to avoid air travel even with the carbon tax. However, I believe that we can change and be climate vanguard through small steps in our lives, such as less driving, more mass transportation, and plant-rich diet. Moreover, as Ken mentioned that politicians and governments are essential in alleviating greenhouse gas emissions and climate crisis since they could support, or even restrict, our daily actions and footprints. It is time for them to play a role. The time is running short and we should make differences now.

I agree with you and I think we need the vanguard right now, there is no time we can waste waiting till everyone is so-called on board. To be blunt, not everyone has been conscious of how vulnerable how environment is, and there is no better way to flex their money than buying more sports cars and mansions, etc. Also, there may be people who can’t help but order far more than they can eat, if there is no one telling them how much we can save from wasting food to help the earth, with the back-up of staggering data, those people can only make some change. It is really shocking that how much we are wasting even before items being consumed, not saying market should sell things expired, what I mean is to produce less, and maybe produce slightly more than what the consumers really need would be a good start. Without the present of vanguard right away, who will be willing to make that change while everyone else just standing still and observe what is going on.

I think we do need a climate vanguard because as we’ve seen, Berkeley’s climate actions tend to set the standard for at the very least California. Without this vanguard, I doubt many would adopt these practices. If we really want to change the world for the better, we need to show the world that these practices work first before the more cautious are able to accept them as viable. For instance, phasing out plastic bags has only become possible because of California leading the charge. I really like the idea of adding a carbon label to all foods in stores. Just like a nutrition label, not everyone will look at it, but those that do can conciencely make decisions to better our planet and eventually, stores will stop stocking up on products with high carbon emissions because they don’t sell.

I agree! We need to take the leap so that others can follow! I also really like the idea of adding a carbon label to all foods in stores. I think it would impact a lot of people and inspire them to shop locally and seasonally. Although not everyone will care, I believe that a good amount of people will. We need to change one person at a time.

The relationship between the climate crisis and cultural change is really important because they influence each other. Whether it is the politicians and the bills that are supported or just whether or not it is socially frowned upon to fly everywhere, the two are very intertwined. I think Ken personally explaining how he is implementing these ideas into his personal lives is really important. To show and exemplify how to be an activist in everyday life especially career-wise is a power influential move because it shows kids to other adults how they can find a way to personalize their activism into their life. I wish we talked about composting. I personally am not aware of how much of an impact that has on emissions or if it does at all. When I was living in New Zealand it was a cultural thing to always compost all food waste as well as only use driers in the winter when the sun can not dry your clothes. It became very apparent how culture and environmental issues are very intertwined and one can influence the other.
 <br><br>
I have always been an advocate for using every part of the vegetable whether in a stir fry or a soup or a curry there are literally endless possibilities and I love seeing that message conveyed to college students (who will hopefully eat some veggies). Eating seasonal is financially and environmentally responsible. Something I personally don’t always think of, but even just googling what foods are in season before grocery shopping is an effective way of being environmentally conscious. I personally did not even think about the fact that that produce that is not in season is flown in, I only ever considered the fact that the quality of produce will be better if it is local and in season. Another great way to get produce is from farmer’s markets. Supporting local farms, less plastic, in season produce, and great quality. I wish more young people took advantage of the farmer’s markets that are in both Goleta and Santa barbara.

You summarize the main point of the video correctly. You mention that “the relationship between the climate crisis and cultural change is really important because they influence each other.” Indeed, culture is one of the most important factor to consider in climate issues. According to you, while you were living in New Zealand, “it was a cultural thing to always compost all food waste as well as only use driers in the winter when the sun can not dry your clothes.” You take yourself as an example in the comment to demonstrate “how culture and environmental issues are very intertwined and one can influence the other.” In your comment, you mention that it is important for us to know what foods are in season before going shopping. I consider it as a necessity as well. Also, I agree with your opinion that people should take advantage of local markets. We should take actions in both Goleta and Santa Barbara as soon as possible.

Addressing the question asked by Ken, I don't think that we should wait because waiting implies that we have time to spare and in all honesty, I don't think we have much time left. If we don't act now, we won't have a future. As a society we must change the habits we have with shopping, driving cars instead of taking public transportation, and more, but will we change, that is the question that should be asked. When society finally realize and connect the dots about the ongoing weather changes, massive fires and rising sea levels with the climate change, will they or will they not act? I don't know. I would hope so but like I said these are habits and habits that are hard to break although you want to. The want and the need are two opposing things because one is more important than the other. However, these two things can have different importance depending on who you are talking to. Some people do stuff because they understand that they need to do it no matter what, whereas the rest of the people only do whatever is expected from them because they want to otherwise they won't. Hopefully, this won't be the situation when we all realize that the climate crisis is real and leading to the extinction of our race.

I think it's very important to address the fact that meat eating is yet another way to express wealth. It highlights Americans constant competition with each other. I believe that this constant need to compete is a major factor of non-environmentally friendly actions. The idea of American "success" needs to be altered before any of these changes Ken asserts are going to have an actual impact. If we have the outlook that success means money, people are going to continue displaying their wealth through the ways Ken talks about in this video. We need to look at success as happiness, not as money. This will make it easier to move away from things such as owning multiple cars, flying to places around the world, and eating far more food than needed.

I also think that these actions such as not flying, not driving, need to be made more accessible before people are going to start making the switch. With veganism, once it became popular, it became a lot easier to become vegan. Now there's a plethora of vegan options at most restaurants and grocery stores. This same energy towards veganism needs to be taken up with other positive environmental actions. If this isn't done, no change is going to occur. Even if we take individual actions, there isn't going to be a major impact until being environmentally smart is made mainstream. People that have the power to make this happen need take action. Leonardo Dicaprio is a fantastic example of this. If more widely known people showed how they were taking action to help the environment, more people would feel as though they should do the same. 
<br><br>

Along with this, more people need to do what Ken is doing. We need to take this information Ken has provided us with, and share it. So many of the things we have learned in this class I had absolutely no idea about, and I consider myself a climate activist. Information needs be spread widely. We have the tools to do it, with our social media platforms, we simply need to take action.

I completely agree with your point on changing the cultural views of the environmental crisis. These changes that are trying to be promoted won't be achievable or viewed as something that should be done until it is made mainstream. The accessibility of these changes needs to be something that should be a larger focus, not simply pushing others to make the changes needed, but making these changes as something that they can easily transition to.
<br><br>
An example of this is the transition to solar energy with the use of solar panels that people place on their homes. It is something that is far more accessible than it ever had been before. It is an investment that people only have to make once and they now benefit with a much smaller electric bill and can even sell the excess that they make to power companies to make a small profit.

I agree completely with everything you said, and In the spirit of of the competitive nature of Americans and always wanting to look like the most privileged the most successful I really can’t think of anything cooler than being called an ‘Architect of the future’!!! Especially because the way to do it is not difficult, while people strive for success and the coolest sounding degree that can take years being a climate vanguard does not take nearly as much money or effort. All it takes is a committed person to make the decision to change their lifestyle and commit to making more environmentally friendly life choices. For example, we need to and I or Ken or the thousands of activists can not stress it enough! We need to vote for the right politicians, because as long as the power at the top combats our issues then it will be much more difficult to pass the necessary legislation and get the desired outcomes that we all need. The number one thing we need is a carbon tax! Which is when the government directly taxes fossil fuel suppliers thus resulting in higher costs in all goods and services that require the emission of greenhouse gases. Overtime such taxes would increase would increase, increasing prices of things such as air travel, gasoline cars, transport etc. This would therefore make electric cars more desirable, solar, wind and other renewable sources of energy more desirable thus changing the manner that we operate as a society. However, despite this the easiest way to make a difference is to change the way we eat and our consumption habits. Limiting waste is the most important, learning how to utilize all parts of fruits and vegetables would not only be beneficial for the environment but also could be a fun and immersive experience for us! 
<br><br>

I really empathize with what Ken was saying about how Beef and meat in general has become so part of our culture and that it would be seen as almost rude to not eat it when you are with family. Coming from a middle eastern family with very strong-willed grandmas not eating their food is seen as a sign of disrespect and meat is such an integral part of every dish served. Our social get togethers are all based around food and a lot of our dishes are based around meat. So In a way we are based around meat! Therefore, it’s easier said than done to disregard these cultural practices that have consumed our society!
<br><hr>
I actually never really thought about how beef has been integrated into “traditional Italian foods” in America. But, thinking back on it, the true Mediterranean diet, as Ken himself said in the video, is mostly based on grains, beans, oil and similar foodstuffs ( with minimal amounts of meat, if any). American beef producers have literally influenced cultures to believe that their traditional food includes beef which, in this case, is untrue. Also, the fact that beef is considered a sign of affluence is very disturbing to me because, looking at my own life, eating beef has always seemed like a integral part of my diet but what if I was just conditioned by American society to think that beef is expensive and is, therefore, tasty and more enjoyable than vegetables?
<br><br>

Ken brings up a really important thing to consider: the fact that many people, especially Americans, will not make the required lifestyle changes to combat climate change until they are more or less forced to do so. Something that is almost 100% necessary to do this? A carbon tax. As a person who has had to attend many in-person and online conferences, I agree that online conferences could work very well. Although there are many issues with having very large online conferences, I’m sure that our technological advances will help us figure out the most worrisome problems.
<br><br>
I think that it would be the best that someone of authority informs the public that the number 1 thing that we can do to reduce our carbon emissions is to reduce our food waste and eating a largely plant-based diet.

It is clear to me that we must start acting now on the subject of the climate crisis. To put it directly, we need climate vanguards now. I admire Greta Thunberg, who at a young age, is already pioneering the younger generation towards preventing climate change. She is someone that we all must try to be in our daily lives, regardless of where we are, politically, economically, and socially. I believe that a carbon tax is the right step towards enacting policies and setting corporations in the right direction. It is evident, however, that many people in the United States will not support a carbon tax. As seen in Obama’s attempt in the cap and trade policy, the public is quick to reject the idea of an increase in price in just about anything. The idea that a plane ticket will cost far more if a carbon tax is enacted will be a shock to many Americans. As sad as it is, I do not think that a majority of Americans will come to terms with the carbon tax in this current time period. However, just because society and cultural practices are against acting in ways to benefit the environment, we can still make an effort to reduce our own carbon footprints. 
 <br><br>
The idea that change can begin at our breakfast table is simple but profound. It is really that simple. Not only can we choose what we consume, but we can also influence others to be aware of what they consume. This is why we need climate vanguards to be the voice for the people who view the climate crisis as a problem. We can all be vanguards to our families, friends, and communities. There should be no excuse to wait for people to simply “come to terms and change their ways.” If we wait then it will be too late because people will not change unless climate change has gotten to the point where their own lives are in danger. By then, Americans will have caused the destruction of millions or even billions of lives in impoverished countries. I was surprised when Ken mentioned how turning vegan or vegetarian does not mean that you are reducing your carbon footprint. This just shows how many layers of complexity and amount of thought an individual must take into consideration when trying to reduce their carbon footprint. Ultimately, I agree with Ken that we must start taking action now and we cannot wait for other people to just come to terms with the need to change. We must become climate vanguards and be active participants and influence people to recognize the realities and dangers of the climate crisis. We must take a “long hard look at our own cultural practices” and keep in mind that every little action can make a huge difference if we have people around us contributing as well.

I agree! I believe it is imperative to start acting now, as opposed to waiting until later on, when it is too late. I do believe flying is an integral part of modern-day life and will be a habit that is hard to kick. Personally, my extended family lives in Texas, my sister goes to college in New York, and my dad works for over two-thirds of the year in Georgia. My family is completely spread out, and we often use flying as a means to see each other because of its convenience. With a carbon tax, we would not be able to see each other as often, which isn't quite as desirable, but I do understand the importance of saving the environment/reducing our carbon footprint. 

 <br><br>

On the topic of food, since starting this class I have been trying to make the conscious decision to wat less meat, and it's been going fairly well! I feel like there's alright vegetarian options in the commons, and if there isn't anything great, I'll try and choose chicken-based meals over red meat. I do think the point that being vegetarian/vegan isn't always the best choice, because of imported vegetables. With that I am at a loss, are we all supposed to eat less? Growing our own food would definitely be best, but I don't know how practical that is. I think Americans need to be more educated about the cost of their actions, even in my APES class in high school, the absolute severity of the situation was never communicated to me, much less about the impact of flying or fast fashion. I didn't realize how many earth-destroying practices were present in American society until recently, it really is appalling how we are brought up to think the world is ours for the taking- even at the expense of others. 

 <br><br>

If we wait to act, the climate will have deteriorated too far to save. I am so worried about the upcoming election, as this is such a crucial time for people to act. It's hard to reason with the fact that a lot of the sweeping environmental changes cannot be enacted by us, but largely by politicians. And of course, older generations with a lot of the voting power don't see the environment as a pressing issue. We need to be self-starters in our own communities and motivate others to make a change.

Besides eating less meat, we also have to stop wasting food. Switching our eating habits can really heavily influence our individual carbon footprint. Before taking this class, I never realize how bad is eating meat. I think Ken said is really making sense, however, it still takes a long time for other people besides this class to realize the situation. There should be more classes on environmental issues. Only by doing this, more people can understand what can they do in order to help the climate.

I didn't see waste as a huge issue prior to this class. My household is a competitive one. We actually competed to see who would waste the least amount of food. Little did I know that even if we were eating every little scrap, food was still being wasted, just on different levels of the supply chain. Here, I see a lot of food on the conveyers in the dining commons. It's easy to grab more food than you can handle. It's also really easy to have a mindset about meat that goes like this: "DLG already made this meat, so there's nothing I can do, it's already been cooked." It's so easy to feel like you have no power. Recently, I've been attempting to cut down on how much meat I eat. I've been semi-successful, but I'm still falling victim to this thought process. 
 <br><br>

I agree with the point you made about other people not in the class, don't have the same knowledge of the consequences of their actions. For me this class has been enlightening. This makes the idea that Denmark has really interesting to me. Just seeing the effects of what you're eating as you eat it could have a substantial effect on the customers.


<br><hr>
I think that for a lot of the topics in this class we need to remember that we are extremely lucky to have this education and learn how we can help the planet, but we need to share that luck. Educate your friends and family. Remind local school boards and politicians that you will support those who educate people about the issue of the century: the climate crisis. If everyone in this class makes an active effort, even if it's a small one, to make sure other people know about the climate crisis, we can really make a difference. Make blog posts, Youtube videos, send in letters to the editor. And, of course, vote! Always vote.
 <br><br>
We do need a vanguard to lead this movement, and I have to say (how many people are in this class? 800?) 800 young people educated in a variety of subjects, from art to computer science, is not a bad choice. And if, say, 800 more people also join that vanguard each quarter, well, that'll add up quickly. Now, imagine if each of those people reached even half as many people as Ken does. Yikes, we'd be unstoppable.

I agree that climate does need a vanguard. A carbon tax should be implemented so that people feel less inclined to use fossil fuels. A  great idea by Ken is to use video chat for meeting located outside the country. This will help deduct the amount of people who travel by plane. Ken's point about the need to change our diet reminded me of a film I watched last quarter. After watching that film, I learned a lot about how much of our planet’s resources are needed in order for animal agriculture to thrive. For example, it takes “upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef” and “660 gallons of water for just one burger.” In addition, I discovered how animal agriculture is affecting marine environments. According to Lisa Agabian who was featured in the film, there will be “fishless oceans by the year 2048.” The film has changed my attitude towards my use of resources and consumption of certain foods. Now that I am informed, I will limit my time in the shower and try my best to conserve more water. In addition, I will consume less beef because consumption of it will only contribute to the problem. I am optimistic about the future because more people like myself are becoming aware. We need to eat less meat, waste less food, and eat a plant based diet.

We absolutely need a climate vanguard. It is going to be impossible to get multiple generations of people who are accustomed to environmentally disastrous habits to suddenly change their habits and reinvent their lifestyles. It is up to my generation to take on this issue full force. I have never been a political person; I have certain views, but I have never taken an interest in politics or felt educated enough to form strong opinions. But this class encourages me to vote and to participate even if that is how I feel because it truly can make a difference. The climate crisis requires legislation because people do not shift out of their comfort zones without being required to. Officials who support a carbon tax, bettering public transportation systems and bike paths, or other environmentally positive actions are crucial to tackling climate change. With airplane tickets on the rise, soaring gasoline prices, and excellent public transportation systems, our population’s habits will shift just like what happened with the tax on cigarettes. 
 <br><br>

I related to what Ken was describing when he said food is a part of culture and that it unites people. It’s hard for me to imagine cutting meat out of my diet completely because I look forward to barbequing with my dad or going out for a nice steak dinner with my mom. I grew up in a meat-centric family as well as society, so I do feel as though it’s a part of my culture. But it was interesting to learn how Americanized our food habits are. We incorporate meat into most meals and have grown used to that. I have to remember we are trying to reinvent our culture for the sake of the environment.

I completely agree with everything said in your comment. Although the climate crisis has already brought many issues upon us and is evidently getting worse as the days progress, many are still very neglectful, refusing to change their habits for the sake of preserving humankind and the many other beloved species that surround us. It is up to our generation and those following us to lead the way in this movement. For years we have put our faith on older generations to bring upon change but now it is time for us to take the baton. For many of the previous years voter apathy among the younger generations has remained high, leaving the fate of our nation in the hands of those who have led us to nothing but trouble. But now, with those who have finally become eligible to vote (like myself), we can finally voice our concerns and elect officials who actually give a damn for the future of our planet. Those who seek to improve public transportation and support the carbon tax in spite of popular opinion are most definitely the ones that should lead our nation. Like you, I've never really been involved in politics; I wasn't even planning to register to vote for this upcoming election. However, I realized just how important it is to have someone that has their priorities set straight, and that is why I am now registered and have in mind who I'm voting for. 

 <br><br>

On a different note, I too struggle with the thought of committing to a plant based diet. Rarely have my family and I eaten any dishes without meat. Growing up we would always cook carne asada (sliced beef) and grill chicken at family parties, a tradition that would ultimately become something that I always look forward to when attending such events. If my diet were to consist of only plant based products, a significant chunk of my culture would be taken away from me. Although it seems very difficult to part ways with foods that have been a part of my culture for quite some time, I recognize that it is time to reduce the amount of meat I consume if not completely switch to a different alternative.

I never really thought about how the American lifestyle regarding consumption has way more meat in it than it should and how many different types of cultural foods brought over here by immigrants have been changed to include more meat. As an Indian, most of the Indian food that I like has meat in it, and now that I think back to my culture and past heritage, most of my past family ate vegetarian dishes, some because of religion, but some also because of the lack of need or desire for meat. Now that meat has become so normalized where we live, it has become commonplace and a meal without meat isn’t as common as a meal with it. As Ken mentioned, we really need to change our daily habits so that we aren’t consuming as much meat as we do now. It is not only very unhealthy but also detrimental to the environment and the earth we live on. I think good alternatives are imitation foods that can taste like meat but are all plant-based. In addition, we must consider seasonal foods that are vegetables too, such as asparagus that is being flown in from Southern America. Ultimately, I hope many others realize this problem with our high meat consumption and actively try to reduce this problem that is destroying our planet.

It's sad how in every country but America, meat is more expensive compared to legumes, vegetables, or fruits. This automatically makes a carnivore diet more accessible, which is detrimental to both the health of low-income families and the country's net greenhouse emissions. As a result, meat is normalized in America, and just like flying, because of America's global culture influence, meat consumption seen as a luxury in other countries. I also came from a long line of vegetarians, as my ancestors were Buddhists  from China, where meat was once very rare, and most couldn't afford it. However, now, my extended family have started to eat meat because the accessibility has increased along with China's economy.  Whenever they learn that I'm vegan, they try to talk me out of it because I'm being "ungrateful" of my privilege. I just think this goes to show how America isn't just doing more than our fair share of destroying the planet, but we are unintentionally using our global culture prominence to influence other countries to follow in our footsteps, and this just so happens to be our unsustainable lifestyles.

I believe the best thing to do is to begin to act now.  For those of us who know where to begin, we begin  to make an effort to make a difference. It will take everyone to get onboard, as Ken mentioned, because we need local and national politicians that will support this movement. Some people unfortunately won’t act until they are “forced to do so.”
 <br><br>
I do believe, making a difference can simply “begin at the breakfast table”. It might be difficult to switch to a largely plant-based diet because of cultural practices for some, but there is a way around though discussion. It is worth an attempt. Besides switching diets, I found it interesting that the cuisine that is imported to the US is reinvented to include large portions of meat. Our American diet does use ample servings of animal products and we have grow accustomed to this type of diet.  As we’ve al probably heard by now, giving up meat once a week can make a difference!

I especially agree with the idea that we must begin with personal choices and changes in order to actually make a difference. With sustainable companies focused on environmental safe economic practices continuing to grow, different ideas and products can help consumers slowly ease into more sustainable practices without making huge lifestyle transformations. Many fear giving up meat completely for a variety of reasons but with plant based alternatives that taste nearly identical to animal meat, many can reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining their preferences. I believe that we must support startup companies that aim to reduce environmental impacts while still allowing the consumers to keep their tendencies the same. Major corporations are doing nothing to curb carbon emissions because their objective has and will continue to be monetary profit.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with your statement that people won't act until they are forced to.  This will probably mean a carbon tax will be most effective.  Some people simply won't want to change their actions, no matter how much evidence you give them or how many times you attempt to appeal to their morals.  Unfortunately, it will probably take charging them substantially for their harmful actions to make them reconsider.  I agree that giving up meat once a week can make a bit of difference, but if we charge more for meat, most families will likely completely do away with it.  I also agree that it is definitely America that is so heavily based on animal products.  As Ken stated in the video, true Italian food is largely plant based, and I also read somewhere that is similar with Mexican food.  Much of Indian food is beef-less if not entirely meatless, and it is similar in many other places in the world.

Yes, Ken I agree. I will not adequately make the changes needed to combat the climate crisis. I am with most Americans in that. I also am not going to be the leader or architect of change that was mentioned. Elections are obviously a key factor but unfortunately us Californians are not the people that need to hear that.  It’s the other states like Iowa and Missouri and Wisconsin that need to be taught that. I do not think that we will be able to convince people to not use Air Travel either. The costs are already expensive and people still do it. It is all about time. People will spend a lot of money for things that take less time because Americans are inherently lazy. 
 <br><br>

When Ken talked about how we would actually be living in the future, one thing crossed my mind. Often times people are asked what the future looks like. I have heard countless people answer with “we’re going to have flying cars in the future.” Well heck wouldn’t that be horrible. All we need is for one car company to start working on that for our planet to be screwed up even more. I think flying cars have got to be what most people think of when they hear a futuristic planet. 
 <br><br>

I am certain that air travel will continue to be a prominent part of traveling for the future forever. Whether that is through the continuation of airplanes and jets or the introduction of flying cars for individuals, our planet is screwed.

Once again we dive into how important our diet is to combat climate change. Ken talks about the importance of our diet and how the way we eat certain foods like meat is damaging our environment. I get this by now in the class and everything that comes with eating meats. I have been taught my whole life to eat my leftovers the next day, or to give it to the dog for a part of their dinner too! Seeing how wasted food is at UCSB and the food courts here is simply disgusting. It goes to show that whatever I might to do for my diet it will be over shadowed when a school will produce waste 10 times as much as I do. I get I am one person to be compared to a food court is not exactly comparable, but even if people like me tried to conserve how we eat it will be overshadowed by other places that put food out for others. The best way to deal with the food diet issue is to convince people that eating plant based diets can be mainstream and popular. This is the only way. Otherwise people will simply not join in the plant based diet lifestyle. Do we need a climate vanguard? Yeah sure, why not. I say this casually because I feel that the people in power in our modern societies will only care about the money that the beef industry creates for their economies. So if we try individually to combat this, eventually we will become a collective to overthrow the government on these policies. Kinda sounds like we need a revolt will be the only way to deal with climate change instantaneously. Not a violent one of course, but one that will grab the attention of the world.

I think it is important to acknowledge that becoming a vegan might not be the best solution. Not because I disagree with veganism, i believe that it is an extremely impactful lifestyle. But i think we too often overlook the other possibilites that are accessible to us. Maintaining a local diet, which is provided by farmers markets or local growers, is a method that I believe should be more publicized. Products always come from somewhere and things do not just magically appear at the stores, which I believe is extremely overlooked. By purchasing products that are from closer locations and that support those markets, it creates a chain reaction where the local economy is fueled, increasing demand and supply. Buying the cheaper alternative could be from across the world, contributing greatly to a persons carbon footprint. i hope Ken discusses this more in lecture!

I always feel sorry about this topic because wasting food is kind of normal for me. When I eat in the dining hall in the university, I always get a plate that full of food that I am not even sure I can finish them all. Also, not only me but also many other people do the same thing like me. Due to these large amounts of food waste, American produces tons of waste per day which are definitely dangerous to our environment. In this way, I think it would be necessary to come up with ideas to solve food waste problem. From my perspective, I think it would be feasible to limit the food that people purchase either from supermarkets or restaurant, so people will not buy a bunch of food that will be wasted at the end. Moreover, in the university dining hall, university should set up rules to ask students finish all the things in their plates or they will be punished in different ways.

“it’s called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it” this quote by George Carlin is what initiated my skepticism and cynicism towards the federal government. Watching your lecture reminded me of that same sentiment. That the world we have been born into is one with a set agenda centered around profit. This country is one large business and the consumers are all blindfolded. The general public is seemingly willingly ignorant to the lack of action being done to help any of todays tribulations. There is seemingly very little progress being made towards the reorganizing of the socioeconomic structure that is ever present in congress. Excluding individual parties for their own self-interest. When the government is on the purse strings of big business, the laws will favor those who write them. So long as these companies can profit effectively without any personal risk, they will continue to run natural resources dry. Until there is no clean water, until there isn’t enough food for everyone, until countries are swept into the ocean, there is be not progress made on the structure of our society until the general public is aware of the consequences of their active participation in the “free market”. So, as long as the public is left in the dark, these major corporations will continue to influence the laws and puppeteer the public’s perception through news media. Inevitably we must change culturally otherwise it will be too late.

Wow! You summed up exactly what's wrong with today's society and government. Big corporations will always try to run our  human and natural resources dry because there is no punishment or penalty for, essentially, their lack of conscience. The saddest part of this situation is that the majority of the public don't seem to care even if they themselves are playing into this whole scheme of things, and as a result becoming worse off. Just a few years ago, I remember watching the movie Elysium starring Matt Damon and thinking how cool and exciting these fictional sci-fi films are. However, I now realize that these dystopian movies no longer exist in the fictional world, but could potentially become the future. When this planet runs out of resources and is left with nothing but garbage, the rich who profited from exploiting resources will move to another planet, whereas the poor will be left behind in a garbage dump, which we once called home, like the movie Elysium.

I definitely agree with your take on society being extremely profit centered. With capitalism running rampant in the US, its becoming increasingly obvious that if the government doesn't take action soon, we'll see even greater destruction that we are currently experiencing. Additionally, these companies are able to influence policy that prevents regulation through lobbying and funding legislators, so the entire system is corrupt. That being said, I think that a lot of members in our government truly do actually care about the issues we face today, and it will take a movement from the people to elect those that will fight for us in order for change to happen. I think that now is the perfect time to ramp up the fight on climate change, because there are no reasons to wait. We as a society, we as the human race, need to start caring about our future, not just monetarily, but in terms of health and well being. Its gone far too long that corporations and the economy will take over our quality of life by brainwashing us into thinking we need the things they are selling. In addition, i think that we need to focus on changing the view of the world for the future, to ensure that anything we do now won't be for nothing. There needs to be, and somewhat already is, the shift to a focus on our future, whether it be through lifestyle changes, technology, education, infrastructure, etc.

In my opinion, we need to act immediately on the climate crisis. We have wasted a lot of time. Most of us are selfish, pursuing a better life and satisfying ourselves with all kinds of materials. Although they know that this will cause a lot of waste, subconsciously forget these things. So we need a leader to force us to face reality and take the climate crisis seriously. In the previous video, I also learned a lot about personal carbon footprint, especially in the field of diet. It's very difficult for me to be a complete vegetarian because I have developed the habit of eating only one meal a day long ago so that I can only eat more vegetables and less meat without affecting my normal life. Although I don't know if I'm reducing my carbon footprint now, I'm trying to give up what I don't need, or what I don't use often, or replace it with something more environmentally friendly.

Ken is telling us to “leave the present behind” which I think is an extremely powerful statement. We always hear about leaving the past behind us, but because the present we are in, relating to climate change and environmental behaviors, is extremely harmful and shameful, we should be leaving that behind too. That is why he is saying we should be “living in the future now.” These simple phrases require and deserve some thought because if everyone understood the importance behind them, I think we would be living in a present state that we would be much more proud of. 
 <br><br>

 We cannot wait for the whole world to come together in order to start trying to mitigate climate change. We just need leaders, and hopefully many of them all around the world, to take action voluntarily. The best leaders are willing to lead without followers or force. With time, this will encourage more and more people to voluntarily climb on board, which will hopefully lead to a change in environmental laws that reflect the previous voluntary acts. The idea of putting the climate footprint facts on food just like nutritional facts is genius. I truly think it will only take a few food companies to do that before it catches popularity and eventually becomes law. Before you had to pay for plastic grocery bags in California, I remember my dad always bringing in reusable bags or just carrying the items to his car without a bag. He took this step voluntarily, but it was because of people like him doing that, that the single use bag ban became a thing. 
 <br><br>

 Actions that people take have a powerful effect on others around them. I for one didn’t know that the reason my dad always brought his own bag was to avoid wasting plastic (I was young and just thought he liked the design on his cloth one). The reason didn’t matter to me though, because I grew up always saying no thank you to a bag even though it would have been free. I believe the same thing can happen for other environmentally friendly movements. If you feel like people fly too much, don’t fly. If you feel like eating animal products is wrong, don’t eat animal products. Chances are, your friends and family will catch on, and then their friends, and then their families, and so on. We do not need to wait for everyone to start making a change. Frankly if we did, the change would never come. In history, big social changes most often came when a few people led without worrying how many followers they had. If they acted in what they believed in, other people noticed, joined in, and eventually the big change occured. That is all we need to do now. We may not see the change for some time, but that is not because we aren’t trying. After all, there was a huge delay in seeing the negative effects of climate change, so maybe we have to be okay with a delay in seeing the progress too.

Yeah I’m also impressed by the point playing with our perceptions for time! 
 <br><br>
In fact, we are all exposed to hundreds of films or science fiction portraying what the future will be like, or how we can do to time travel. However, according to Ken, if you want to live in the future, just leave the present behind and start to live like the future! This is so clever an argument that I surely have no words to oppose. And another thing is also true if employing this logic: rather than being in the future with glamorous high-tech inventions, it is more practical to shift your focus from what you cannot immediately achieve to what you can personally adopt right now. Therefore, I am more inclined to take on the resolutions from now on and definitely, managing my diet is becoming a cooler thing in any sense!
<br><hr>
I agree with you that Ken’s idea of leaving the present behind is the most impactful theology in tackling how we respond to the climate crisis. There is always something more that we can do in combating environmental justice whether it be changing lifestyle choices or being socially active in fighting the crisis. When we think to leave the present behind, it inflicts a mindset that pushes greater efforts in doing so. Because much of Western culture revolves around exerting greenhouse gases through our purchasing power and the lifestyle habits we hold, we must unlearn these pre-conditioned tendencies we presently live by, for there is so much that needs to be done. We must be the climate vanguards that spearhead these efforts by focusing on the future, rather than our present efforts. I also agree that the idea of adding climate footprint facts on nutritional labels would be revolutionary in how we can limit temperature rise. This idea was just made known to me through Ken’s video, but would have profound effects. However, it would be very hard to convince legislation to create policies that may hurt the economic interests of companies that expand the economy. This idea sparks a lot of room for innovation, and the logistics should be contemplated. I think a good start would be for sustainable food companies to add these carbon footprint facts onto their own labels, and compare them to their competitors, who use more destructive production and shipping consequences. Another tactic would be for supermarkets who claim to be eco-friendly to use newsletters that inform their consumers about the best in-season products and sustainable brands to sway them into buying brands in which they believe are ethical. For instance, with the example Ken had mentioned, buying asparagus in the winter is not anymore sustainable than buying chicken. The in-season vegetables could then be at the forefront of the store’s promotions, possibly tagged with recipes that it could be integrated with.
<br><hr>
You quickly touched on the idea of "unlearning tendencies" that are harmful to the environment  and I think that is a really good point. We always hear about learning new ways to reduce our carbon footprint, but really that is only half of the problem. Yes we should be incorporating new things like plant based diets and turning off light switches etc, but really we need to unlearn so many things. We need to stop more things than we need to start; we need to stop flying, stop buying into fast fashion, etc. Honestly, I think the place to start is to stop bad habits, because it may be easier than starting some new ones.

Being an "architect of the future" is really challenging when we truly do not know how much carbon we are emitting with our actions. For instance, the example that Ken gave us regarding asparagus consumption in the winter is mind-boggling. You'd think that eating a green diet would be beneficial for the planet. However, I was surprised to hear that it is not much better than eating chicken or pork due to the costs of airplane emissions. This makes me rethink many of my actions that I consider to be environmentally friendly. For example, for dessert today I had strawberries instead of ice cream (which contains dairy products). Before watching this video, I'd probably be proud of my dessert choice, thinking that I am doing a service for the earth. But this lecture has made me question how far these strawberries have traveled to arrive at my local grocery store and if it's even strawberry season. It feels like no matter how much we strive to be eco-conscious, there is always going to be some backlash with the alternatives. There's just no transparency with our food and it needs to be explicitly conveyed in grocery stores. For this reason, I do believe we need climate vanguards who will convey to the public the effects of our daily actions and choices. Most people will not go out of their way to search for this information, so if we had a climate vanguard who presented this, the message would be spread more easily. Our society is, for a lack of better words, extremely lazy. But, a climate vanguard would eliminate the process of the public having to go out of their way to research, and allow this spread of information in a more convenient, efficient way. We, as a society of informed students, need to utilize our knowledge and begin this green revolution before it's too late.

I completely agree with you. With so much contributing to the climate crisis at once, it is difficult to know what you should and shouldn’t do. We’ve been hearing throughout this whole course that switching to a plant-based diet will help reduce the emissions that we are causing by eating meat. But now, you need to figure out where plants are being imported from in order to know if it will contribute to the climate crisis or not. I was also surprised to hear that consuming asparagus in the winter is really no better than eating chicken or pork. I would have thought just because it isn’t meat it would be a lot better for the environment. It’s a lot to think about when you’re just trying to get in a meal. I think the climate labels Denmark is trying to put on food would be very effective in helping reduce the amount of carbon emissions we cause due to what we are eating. This would make it much simpler to make the correct choices when we are shopping for our food.


<br><hr>
I relate a lot to the complex nature of being eco-conscious. I get anxious every time I want to buy anything, whether it's food, clothes, or even soap. Even though I agree that having some kind of climate vanguard (and maybe multiple vanguards) would aid our progress, I do think a lot of the issue is the way our society is built. It is hard to remember what each and every ingredient or resource is best for what and when. I don't think everyone should have to think so hard to be sustainable. Even when I try to do that, I miss some things. I personally have found that it would take more than just a few minutes for me to figure out how to go about buying one item. There are so many factors that go into every single thing. What we need is a system change to help with that. Not an individual or group of individuals doing all the research and educating us, but researching and making societal changes that would be more effective--making changes that affect more people at once. For stores, it would be indicating what fruits are in season, and can often be indicated by price. I believe some shops do offer seasonal produce for discounted prices. System changes like these would make sustainability more natural for the average person.

We have been sitting and doing nothing for the past 60 years. We cannot continue, but for some reason, no one can make a simple behavior change by eating lentil curry instead of a cheeseburger with fries and a milkshake. I understand that the impact requires an institutional and personal shift but we can start somewhere can't we? It's really frustrating how integral meat and dairy products have become to our whole society over a year of advertising and exponential growth.
<br><br>
Aside from people switching to a plant-based diet, Ken's video opened my eyes to the issue of food transport and need for the slow food movement. If we import produce that isn't naturally in season at that time or isn't grown locally that's similarly as bad as eating a product like chicken. For example, I'm currently following a plant-based diet and people ask me if I would ever eat animal products again and I say yes. I would eat animal products if I lived on a farm and new where every product was coming from and managed every part of the process. A huge part of the problem with animal agriculture is the amount of waste produced which also affects water sources and the oceans, and also the fuel and emissions from transporting the products as well as manufacturing. You can eliminate a lot of those factors without becoming vegan, vegetarian, or pescatarian, but by just buying locally and buying organic.
<br><br>
Relating this lecture video to the documentary, "Cowspiracy", it scares me that a majority of America is likely oblivious, in denial, or they have just lost hope and given up. I don't believe that my generation has lost hope but individuals in my generation also aren't holding most elected positions in the government. One of the ideas(not relating to food) that sounds possibly very effective is increasing the price of air travel to encourage people to fly less, also improving public transit infrastructure is very plausible and could be backed by OUR government). For plenty of the boomer generation, life is maybe half over but they're looking at it as the glass is half empty not half full. Why wouldn't every human work together to mitigate climate change? What do you have to lose? I know change is scary for most people, especially behavior change, but why not do it for your grandchildren and great-grandchildren?

I totally agree. Although we know what the healthier option is for ourselves and our environment, so many people fail to change their patterns. Whether this is due to pricing, advertising, or pure negligence, the actual amount of people willing to change their diet seems small. However, we will make no progress in fighting climate change if people don't fight the societal norms to eat high amounts of meat and dairy. I agree with Ken's proposal to place climate labels on the food we eat. Just thinking about UCSB, I wonder if people would make different decisions on whether or not to pick a burger at the dining hall if there was a sign explaining it's damages towards the environment. If anything, these labels could help fight the complacency that people show when consuming goods. If they pick up a pound of a package of beef, at least they have to acknowledge that they could be wasting 2500 gallons of water. 

<br><br>
Additionally, I was also unaware of the consequences of transporting food. Although I knew that eating local was a good option, I always thought about it for economic and health reasons rather than environmental. I agree with your analysis of when its okay to eat meat. As I evaluate my own choices with my diet as I learn more and more about the climate crisis, I will keep this in mind! :)
<br><hr>

While we need change to save our planet, cultural change, like the one you are suggesting, takes decades, if not centuries. To alter the mindset of millions needs the efforts of corporations, government, and major world events. Unfortunately for us, none of the three are working in our favor. Climate change, unlike other world events like 9/11 or world wars, is slow, yet steady. There's no sudden headlines or breaking news, yet it is the generational issue that we are all dealing with. Not only does it not spur action, the change that it incurs is so slow that many don't even believe that it exists. This mindset is detrimental for change. As for corporations, many are on the opposite side of the issue. They don't want change, because they don't profit off of it. In an attempt to stop change, they put out ads, implement policies that ignore environmental consequences, and influence lawmakers via monetary backing. If corporations have such a large impact on government actions, the change that is needed will take many, many more years.

I agree that implementing a tax would be successful. Considering that this would lead to an increase in air travel cost, people would probably decrease their travelling or even stop. After ken explained the online conferences model, it seems as it can actually work. The problem would be to convince the entire world to do it. Like ken says, we need a group of people to lead us to a change. In regards to food and how it correlates with culture, I truly agree it can be hard. For instance, in my culture, there must be some type of meat all the time. Otherwise it is not food. This largely happens in parties in which the top meats to be served are beef and pork. The idea of vegetables being processed into meat seems ridiculous in my culture. Such a thing is not even considered food. However, I think that it is possible to create a change in culture. Cause if you make aware the consequences of eating meat such as making known how animals and people die because of meat production, people can have personal feeling towards these consequences and do change after all. Moreover, if a large group of people do it, then the rest will follow. That is what happens in culture, you do what the rest do. I truly think that change is possible.

In this lecture, Ken offers us solutions to the climate crisis. All of these solutions are doable, however just hard because they require us to abandon our luxuries that we have become so used to. Ken mentions taking out the usage of air travel in favor for slow travel in his lecture. This will be especially hard for me, because I love going to places, however I hate the time it takes to get from one point to the other. It is going to be hard, however I am willing to make that sacrifice in order to help the battle against climate crisis.

<br><br>
I do believe that we need a vanguard for the climate. The population is still highly unaware of the consequences of the climate crisis. If people truly knew the consequences and how our everyday life brings us closer and close to the imminent disaster of climate change, I believe people would be more willing to change. We need someone who can educate the mass population, and we need one now.

I also agree that climate vanguard is necessary. This is needed not only to educate the large population about how horrible disasters can come closer and closer to our living environment but also educate on how our specific actions are leading to those insane outcomes. It is very true that most people are reluctant to change their currently carbon-rich & luxurious lifestyles in order to save our planet, especially given the fact that there is a delay in witnessing the results of climate change. This climate vanguard, however, needs to be someone who is really devoting time and effort into actually enforcing actions and making contributions. I don’t think our planet necessarily needs another Greta Thunberg. Yes, this girl is influential in calling for strikes and awakening more youths to realize the significance of environmental protection and join the cause. However, waiting for the system and legislation to change isn’t realistic, comparing to physically making changes by yourself. If there is a climate vanguard, hopeful this will be a truly influential one in promoting people to take small actions in their lifestyles, such as switching to a plant-based diet, drive less, fly less, etc… All the solutions in this video are feasible, and yes, we are in dire need of a vanguard who can enforce the actions going on.

I agree with Ken that many people will not voluntarily change their lifestyle so part of the solution is holding people accountable for how they are damaging the planet, via something like a carbon tax. Overall, food should be one of our main focuses when solving the climate crisis and we have a lot of personal power because the food offered is influenced by demand. To answer Ken’s question, I believe we should of course act now. Change has to start somewhere and personal choices have a ripple effect both by influencing business through demand but also by changing our lifestyles, we send a message to all the people around us about what we are doing and we get a chance to explain why. Political change won’t come without this movement either. Politicians are elected by the people so someone who will fight for positive change for the environment will need backing by people who are passionate about it. I don’t think it’s right to see a problem and ignore it just because everyone else doesn’t see it yet.

One of the points in this lecture was how we need to elect politicians that support / implement programs that charge for carbon who would impose a carbon tax directly tax fossil fuel suppliers. This consequently would make anything that releases fossil fuels into the atmosphere more expensive from more expensive gas to air travel increasing greatly. Though I see how this is a great idea and attacks people where it hurts -- their wallet, their earnings --I can’t help but think about how the elite would find loopholes. The rich, though begrudgingly, can afford it. They would make the budget work to leave them with a surplus of profit, even if that meant laying off their workers. That leaves the middle to lower class hopeless. It could result in them without a job and spending more money than they can afford because of their consistent carbon tax driving and everything. Also, when thinking of this tax, I cannot help but think about how there’s billionaires that don’t pay any taxes and underpay their employees!     I could see them adopting the idea of travel free conferences, but I would wonder if it is for their own busy schedule to maximize profit or if they would advertise themselves as eco-friendly that way. In all honesty, I lack a lot of trust in corporations. With their massive wealth, plenty could have made a major difference by now.
<br><br>

As Ken asked, are you an architect of the future? I already assumed an answer for the financially stable. I take this question as will I help build the future, the future that requires alterations in lifestyle to mitigate the climate crisis.
<br><br>

I want to say yes. And regarding later or now, I definitely want to start now. Ken actually took a poll in class of what would be the hardest change for us to adopt. I am willing to bike, carpool, and use public transportation. I am willing to give away my excess things, becoming more minimalist. I am willing to live in an apartment or the smallest space that can still accommodate my future household size without being more than needed. Eating is where I face difficulty.
<br><br>

I was a picky eater growing up and a part of that sticks with me today. I have a lot of other favorite foods / cuisines that I can and would want to eat very often. In addition to this, I come from an Asian American family. The household culture can be summed up as not eating being equivalent to disrespect. Attempts at dieting hard at home because of the only food being provided was Asian food, full of carbs and cholesterol. This would offset any attempts to be healthy. Even at home, trying to diet is hard too… From my picky roots, a plant-based diet hurts me. But hey, San Francisco vibes! Giving up meat is especially hard and it is a great step to alter lives to mitigate the plant based diet.
<br><br>

Diets of the future are being worked out. This would have to do with reducing animal products in our diet and reducing food waste, even a tad bit more important. Rethink about what we eat and ensure to not waste! Vegetables are more edible than you think.

I agree that although we can create more carbon taxes and make the use of carbon exponentially more expensive, people WILL find loop holes! A lot of people think that because the government creates laws and mechanisms to ensure that people aren't doing things that no one ever does those things. Sadly, people break the law everyday! What would stop big companies and rich people from finding loop holes in the carbon tax economy. 
<br><br>

We blatantly need people to CARE more to see a difference in the way the climate crisis is treated. People do not understand the dire effects that are already happening and have been happening for many years. This weekend I went to Tahoe and there was NO SNOW. It was quite depressing now that I know its not just a bad snow season; its our fate. 
<br><br>

I also understand where you're coming from with the dietary issues. My family is very conservative with politics and with eating. Everyday we have a sit down dinner where we eat either steak, lamb, or chicken. And how many families in America still eat like that EVERYDAY? A LOT!!!!! We need to get people to break their cultural boundaries and try new things!

We 100% need a climate vanguard. To wait would confuse politicians of our priorities. We must take these issues into our own hands first, show politicians and people in power just how important these issues are to us and that they can't wait--because it's true. If we were to wait, we would only be worsening our emissions and making it more difficult to reverse what we're doing.
<br><br>
The most significant changes are community and global ones. Like Ken mentioned, unplugging a charger for a day does almost nothing compared to using public transportation or biking. We can put our energy to use where it makes a larger impact. It can be discouraging to be one of the few who refuses air travel, meat consumption, etc., because it can feel like opportunities are being missed. That's how I feel sometimes, and I know many must feel similar discouragement. I try my best not to be annoying when reminding a friend how bad meat can be for both personal and climate health. It can feel like nobody is on my side and my efforts are worthless. However, I know that the embarrassment or discouraging feelings are temporary and what I'm doing is important, and somewhere someone else is making a similar positive effort. 
<br><br>
It comes down to practice, consistency, and demonstration. We learn from one another every day, we're constantly taking in information. I think that the climate vanguard's strength is building a community. For example, there are many eco-friendly clubs here at UCSB and in IV. It's amazing to see how proactive these young adults are, not excusing the issues to politicians or the future. They're making efforts now, and it's so easy to join them and be a part of the vanguard. We have these resources, we just need to reach out!

Unfortunately, we do absolutely need a climate vanguard in order to make any real change. Whenever I hear about all of the changes that can be made on a personal, day-to-day basis, I honestly find myself frustrated since about 50 corporations today account for ~70% of greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in diet make can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but I can't help but think about low-income families who can only afford to feed their family and not account for how eco-friendly their meals are. I've always felt like these solutions can come across as preachy to people who can't afford to have a steady plant-based diet, or think about the sustainability (or lack of) behind every purchase made. But I think then it is up to those who can speak up to step up and enact change. I completely agree that building a community is the best way to build strength for climate vanguard. Although this situation was not our fault, it is now our responsibility to fix this crisis.

<p>
I agree with Ken's question, I think we should be acting now because people will only begin to be on board once they see others doing so. It's very unlikely that everyone will eventually be on board without seeing any cultural change already. Culture tends to spread so even if it's just one community in America acing differently than the rest, their ideas and actions will soon be adopted by other people. This is how we fix the climate crisis. However, it is much more difficult being in the minority while trying to live an eco-friendly lifestyle when much of our country's culture makes it a pain to do so.  In terms of flying, it would be unfair to raise ticket prices because it would reserve flying just the upper class and prohibit some families from ever visiting each other due to geographical barriers ground transportation can't get by.

I really felt what Ken said about a child disrupting or disrespecting their culture by refusing to eat meat. Me being of Hispanic descent, particularly Mexican, my family loves meat in dishes including chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc. and it could make things hard. I know I have considered changing to a plant based diet but I can't quite push myself to do it because of 1 what my family would say and 2 at family gatherings i would practically have nothing to eat. Food is definitely a cultural thing that brings my family together. Every other weekend we'll have a gathering  just to eat food as a family. My family is so big that the head count could get up to 20 maybe 30 people just family alone. On some occasions family friends are brought over as well as our neighbors pushing it to 50. I know Ken said that large meat based diets originated from the US but my family is from Mexico and we eat damn near every part of the cow. My family definitely would be judgmental and have something to say if I said I no longer eat meat or even refuse the food. My Grandma would even go to the extent of saying that I don't like her food and who in their right mind could let their grandma believe that. Besides the cultural aspect I myself don't believe I would last because I grew up eating meat and as an athlete in high school that was the staple dish to gain weight while staying in shape. I do believe that we need people to take action now because if I myself can see people do it successfully with a similar background then i would really consider it but a lot of the people that I know are already making the change are definitely from different backgrounds where it is already accepted. I'm sure the same applies to other people. Once it becomes more popular, they'll follow it because there will be more available to make the change smoother.

I can relate to your statement a lot, also coming from a Mexican family, meat has always been an integral part of our diet. There are few meals my family makes that don't incorporate some type of meat in it. I can't imagine what it would be like for someone in my family to try and live off a completely plant-based diet, they would probably not be able to eat anything my grandma or mom makes at all.  I know how difficult cutting out meat from my diet would be initially, but I know I really need to make the change. I have already tried to cut down my beef intake and stick to chicken until I can eventually cut that down too. As much as I love beef, I need to think: do I love it as much as I want a healthy and stable planet. I really hope I can eventually persuade my family to join me in this goal, I'm hesitant on how successful I will be, but I will try nonetheless. I am also interested in Ken's fact that many of the cultural diets we believe have meat as a staple, are only that way because they were reinvented in the U.S. to incorporate meat. It makes me reevaluate how much of our Mexican diet originally contained an emphasis on meat and how much more did it actually centers around plant-based diets. I see how Western attitudes have imposed itself even on people's cultural diets. 
<br><br>
It's important that people start taking steps into changing their habits whether it be flying or beef consumption because if more people do it together, even more, will follow.

Our planet is facing a serious challenge which will affect ourselves too. Although there are many people has the awareness of climate crisis, they do not give responses to the severe condition. To be honest, if we want protect our planet, we will damage some people’s profits. For example, a scientists who appeal people stop cutting down Amazon rainforest was murdered by citizens of Brazil. Because deforesting is one of the most crucial way for people to make money. We need some vanguards to speak out. More people should realize the importance of protecting our planet. Some small changes will induce a big difference!

<p>
The time to act is now. Our clock is ticking. The more people that reevaluate their diet, the more people that will catch on and join. The food that we eat and the food that we waste is something we have total control of. Our future was predicted by Thomas Malthus in 1798. At some point, the food supply will not be able to catch up with the exponentially increasing population. The human race will starve. We must be prepared to make cultural changes now.
<br><br>

I think the idea of climate labels on food would be very beneficial in the United States. Food products have nutrition labels that remind us what we are consuming. Climate labels would be a reminder of what the planet is consuming. I was unaware that eating asparagus is just as bad as eating meat in the winter because of the emissions from shipping. I think the more knowledgeable the public is on what they consume, the more likely the public will make wiser decisions for their body and planet.
<br><br>

I get anxious when I see food being wasted. Growing up, my family and I would eat dinner together. No meal was considered finished until every plate was empty. Sometimes, I would sit at the dinner table for an hour. Though I didn’t realize it at the time, my parents were teaching me a life lesson. We have to realize our resources are scarce and will not be available forever.

I was always raised to not waste food. I never understand why people waste food. Whenever I eat in the dining halls here at UCSB, I always see people grabbing food and they end up not touching it. Whenever I notice that, I always wonder why they grabbed it in the first place and how they don't feel bad throwing it away. It also shocks me how much food is thrown out every single day because they cook too much in the dining halls. That level of waste just seems extremely excessive to me and it can absolutely by reduced by a lot.

In the lecture, it distinguishes the possible solutions to overcome the climate crisis and to prevent it. He emphasizes that we should vote for electors who are trying to make a difference in climate change. Airplanes produce tons of greenhouse gas which leads the planet to be in worse conditions. If we raise the prices on flying, this will cause less people going on planes and improving our conditions. It is kind of difficult for professors to attend academic conferences, but technology is improving so we can establish more apps and ideas that we can do at conferences online. There are many solutions to avoid flying and are able to prevent flying in many kinds of ways.
 <br><br>
In addition, the film also focuses on the food waste and to reflect on our actions  to prevent the waste of food and to purchase the food that we eat and use. It also distinguishes that we should improve our diet and distinguish what the diet of the future will be like. We should eat more greens and vegetables than eat more meat. Science meat causes a lot of greenhouse gases. We should minimize the food waste and switch to distinguish diets to throw away less food.

I agree with you, as I feel like voting for politicians that support climate action will be the most beneficial. I feel that if the government would start to adhere to more eco-friendly options, the problem would be fixed much quicker rather than other options that were mentioned. If we were to accomplish this, I believe the change on an institutional scale will have profound changes even more than what we can do as a society.

What I find unbelievable is that schools all over the world don't include environmental studies as a part of their core curriculum. It is imperative for schools to be educating kids more and more about the climate crisis. Prior to taking this class, I'm going to be honest I had a very minimal baseline knowledge of the climate crisis and its effects. However, what I did have a great deal of knowledge on was Pythagoras' theorem and finding the effects of metaphors in a passage. Now unless, SOH CAH TOA is going to give us an insight to the climate crisis, it is objectively useless. It completely baffles me that I have such a deep understanding of a topic so useless yet I have the littlest of knowledge on a topic that is so imminent and detrimental to mankind. Sure, switching to a plant-based diet is effective. Sure, biking instead of using a car is effective. Sure, reducing the amount of times you fly is effective. However, the school systems are ineffective. They are ineffective in terms of educating those who will most likely suffer the very worst end of the stick from the climate crisis. Now although classes are offered in high school, I personally think that environmental studies should be embodied in the core curriculum in every school like English and Math.

I agree with you! A lot of the "change we need" as mentioned in this class starts with our education. Prior to this course, a majority of my academic career and courses rarely expanded on the growing climate crisis. From kindergarten to high school, the only thing related to climate change that I was taught was recycling and how that would be enough to save our world. Looking back on it now, I can see how naive and uninformed the entirety of my generation was. Not only do I feel extremely lied to, but I feel even more frustrated that I wasted all those years not doing enough.
<br><br>
Implementing change begins with what we learn in school. Which should be taught to students starting from the beginning of their academia and for the rest of their lives. I definitely agree with your standpoint on this one. School systems should embrace the teachings of environmental studies and stress climate change. Oftentimes, we are so caught up in our lives, we forget that what we are living on is living (or at least trying to) too.

I think the right answer in this situation is not necessarily what will happen. Yes, we should act now, implement sweeping climate action and prevent as much future catastrophe as possible. However, this likely isn’t going to be the case. Much of it is going to depend on whoever enters the oval office in the beginning of 2021. If the next president decides that they will be the first to truly tackle the climate crisis fully and fight for sweeping climate action, then we may be in a decent place. Topics like the Green New Deal and a carbon tax need an administration that will back them fully if they are to pass through congress anytime soon. 
<br><br>

 Personally, I think it may be another decade of disasters and displacement before the overwhelming majority of U.S citizens can create enough support to overrule fossil fuel interests and get serious legislation passed. I also highly doubt that a significant chunk of people are likely to embrace a culture that doesn’t fly or eat beef unless they are forced to give up those things. The country is historically built on resistance to that sort of thing, and people tend to take pride in that fact. Therefore, I think our greatest hope definitely lies in how fast we can get elected officials in office that will fight for laws that will dramatically change how we live for the security of future generations. The good news is that there are young, driven politicians entering the game right now that are getting a lot of media attention and seem to have very promising political careers ahead in very influential positions.

Individualism is a debated set of ideas that allows people to be themselves and distinguish themselves from others. In the case of saving climate change, individualism actually promotes and speeds up the process of individual awareness. If the majority of the world is in a collective society, the thirst for profit might impede individuals with ideas of saving the climate. But because the United States promotes individualism, people who wants to make a change and be different from the mass public could do so at any time. As Professor Hiltner said, we do need a climate vanguard, and each one of us could be a climate vanguard starting from changing our own actions. By switching to a vegan diet, taking more public transport as well as buying less thing this individualistic ideology would soon spread and become collective.

We are put in a challenging position as young people in today's world. We not only have to clean up the mess left for us by previous generations, but we also must clear our own path and figure out a way to completely rewire our way of life. Because of this, being an architect of the future is no easy task. There is no clear instruction to follow. We must educate ourselves and learn as we go. Historically, this makes sense. Revolutions don't just happen one morning and then the course of history is changed later that day. Revolutions need people; they need leaders who are passionate enough to do all the hard work for the rest of the population. This is why we can't just sit and wait for the rest of the world to get on board because by the time everyone or even just most of the population wakes up and realizes we need change, it's going to be too late. This is a climate CRISIS. This word should warrant immediate action yet for decades of knowing the scary fact of our impending doom, we've seen the people in charge place more importance on what seems like every other issue except the environment. 

<br><br>

At this point, we should know that people are not going to come to their senses in time to save our planet. It is our job as students and as the new generation of leaders to educate ourselves on how best to approach this and teach and inform the rest of the world. Just from this video we gained the knowledge that the best thing we can do for the planet is to drastically limit food waste and switch to a plant-based diet, so let's figure out how to implement this, and revolutionize the way our world works before it is too late.

Food waste is major pollution and a problem. This is also one of the major causes of climate change and pollution. Since we know that animal husbandry is the major cause of pollution and greenhouse gases releasing. And according to the newest research, average American waste around a pound of food per day. That is a big waste. Average American eats around 5.5 pounds of food daily. This means each American waste around 20% of the food daily. If people, who from developed countries, can reduce food waste, I believe this will bring a significant change to climate change and reduce greenhouse gases releasing.

I think a climate vanguard might not be necessary but serve as a more religious icon. I do not think the influence of a climate vanguard will do much practical things to improve the environment. Although a climate vanguard might serve as a promoter of the climate topic, but the society is not only asking for a promoter but actions to change the current situation. Political involvement of vanguards is active and I do not believe a climate vanguard is necessary to take actual actions.

I think that it is important for us as a society to change the way we consume food. 1/3 of the food produced goes to waste, which is a disaster ecologically and doesn’t make economic sense. I was raised to eat all the food I put on my plate and I have brought that here to college. While there is so much food wasted in the dining commons, decreasing the amount of food produced overall is not the solution. If someone really wanted a piece of pizza and they are told, “Sorry we ran out of pizza 30 minutes after we opened for dinner,” they are going to be upset, and they paid for their meal just like everyone who ate the pizza. I think a solution to this would be to count how many servings of each type of prepared food are eaten at each mealtime. They could then analyze the data to find out the optimum amount of each menu item to make for each meal so there is just enough and less waste. This would also allow them to find out which dishes people just didn’t like so they could not make that again, saving resources and serving students the food we want to eat.

I do believe that food waste is an issue at the UCSB dining commons. If you look at the dish racks, there are tons of plates with half eaten dishes on it. I think students here have the mentality of an all-you-can-eat buffet: it doesn’t matter if you just want to take one bite because it is already paid for. This presents a huge amount of waste; students will take one of everything and eat a little of each, wasting half of every dish, instead of only taking a few dishes and eating the entirety. 
<br><br>
I think it is a decent idea to have the dining commons try to optimize the amount of each dish they produce. Not every student likes the same food, but if the cooking staff and managers at the dining commons know to make more of one dish and less of another, there would be less food waste. I imagine the commons do something along these lines now, but in order to really cut back on wasting, there must be a more efficient way. I think analyzing the data thouroughly and carefully is a good idea.


<br><hr>
I agree with you, we do need to change the way we consume food. I remember hearing that if people had three wishes one of the wishes will to end world hunger but we can. Knowing that we can feed everyone on this planet but instead of doing that we waste one third. It is the same for me when it comes to food on my plate, my parents always told me to eat until I get full and if I have extra food that I should save it. I do that till this day, lets say I go out and I do not finish my food I either give it to one of my friends or save it for the next day. It really does suck knowing that the dining commons waste so much food but I think the compost some of it, if that helps. I really like the plan you proposed because it would be really beneficial if we had that data. We just need to give it time I think because I feel like UCSB is really environmentally friendly. One of the dining commons usually does green Mondays which may not help a lot but it is better than nothing. But collecting data of what we eat and how much we eat can help out a lot.

<br><hr>

I agree with you that our society needs to change because we are wasting too much. In terms of food, fashion, and products, in general, are just being wasted or thrown away. People are over-consuming and are just throwing away the things that they don't want anymore. I work at the dining hall and I can agree that a lot of food goes to waste. From people not finishing what they serve themselves to the leftovers at the end of the day. The rest of the food that remains at the end of the day is just thrown away. Food waste is the main issue because it requires gallons of water to raise the food and tons of CO2 to make it and transport it. We are a society that likes to over-consume and then just throw away the rest. It is a major issue but it has an easy solution which is to eat a control portion size of food. It is an easy fix that will decrease the amount of waste and help the planet.

<br><hr>
Coming from a Mexican household where food is basically always finished, it was quite strange fo me to come to UCSB whereas a community the amount of food waste and leftovers is an incredible number at a daily basis. In regards to my culture, leaving leftover food is a sign of disrespect to the cook who made it. One because they put that effort into working in the kitchen to make you food, and two because of all of the work that it took to raise the plant or animal that your food became. Everything is used as many times as possible until wear and tear takes over, and only then is it ok to throw it away. Before coming to Santa Barbara, I had this school and the region closely related to environmental friendliness but as I've spent more time here, I've come to see that many points this school advocates create hypocrisy within its own boundaries.

People follow when there is a leader and whether or not there is a large or small following will make or break a cause but the movement starts with at least one person and in this case the "vanguard" should be a large amount of people. However, I feel like we don't just need someone to lead but policies that force us in the right direction. When I heard that Ken gave up flying and how much it affected his work I was so shocked he didn't just start flying again- his career is his livelihood but hearing his way around that inspired me to think that change is so possible when you want it. My mom always told us this saying that states when you want something, you will make it work and I feel the inconvenience of minimizing CO2 emissions often overshadows our want of saving the Earth. Ironic, I know but in reality there is so much that we could do but we are either ill informed or just do not see things worth it. So I feel that doing our part would be greatly easier if we needed to follow something. Even though we know better because we are informed, we still do not always live up to our expectations. 
<br><br>
I feel like there are so many things that we do that add to climate change that sometimes thinking about it makes my head spin. Eat less meat,  do not fly, do not drive, do not leave things plugged in, do not buy into fast fashion and the list goes on and it feels so exhausting. Then I think about how I should do things in baby steps, try to eat less food that creates large amounts of CO2 ( like Denmark released information), take the bus more even if it is 2 days out of the week and even more small things. But change like this is still small and when it becomes easier I will soon drift apart from more environmentally bad habits. Yet this is something I plan on doing, the opposite can be said for a lot of people and when forced to be more environmentally conscious will definitely piss people off but save us in the process. We need politicians who are not in the hands of consumerism but are for the Earth. We needed a climate vanguard years ago and need to get started as soon as possible.

 I completely agree with you. In all honesty, I am totally for less beef consumption in today's society but people will not commit to it. As for a climate vanguard, our generation is too addicted to consumerism and therefore cannot have a more simplistic lifestyle. Like your mom mentioned, "When you want something, you will make it work". The problem is that people do not want to save the planet. The baby steps you talk about are a great way to start practicing environmentally sustainable ways. As we have learned lecture, the biggest contributors to climate change are burning fossil fuels, the beef industry, population, and transportation.  The average American contributes to this by driving a car, eating meat, having children and using oil. If we ever have a vanguard, I agree it must consist of honest political leaders and administrators who are willing to leave their private interests aside. 
 <br><br>
Hence, I strongly believe the only way we can advocate and do something about climate change is by focusing on the youth. The current generation does not care enough about the future conditions of this planet. Our political leaders in power today are not doing their best to control carbon emissions.

To answer Kens' question if whether or not we should begin acting now on mitigating the climate crisis or if we should wait until everyone gets on board seems like a trick question to me. I believe there is only one right answer to this question: yes, we should begin acting now. Why would we want to wait for everyone? This goes back to a few weeks ago when we were on the topic of transportation and how cars are very dangerous for our planet and Ken had mentioned that we can't wait for people such as Elon Musk to come up with something - we must begin to act now! If we were to wait for everyone, either no change would be made or our earth would already be uninhabitable. Once we start making individual changes to our lifestyles, the ones around us will eventually start to catch on, and the ones around them will do the same, and hopefully it just keeps going and everyone is involved in the fight for a change. (This is me being very optimistic.) 
 <br><br>
I never once would think that I would cut off the amount of meat I eat - no I have not entirely switched to a plant based diet yet, but the amount of meat I now consume compared to what I used to eat has dramatically changed. I grew up in a household in which we ate meat everyday - we couldn't have a meal without some type of meat on our plate. During highschool there would be times where I would switch my diet to a vegetarian one just for the hell of it - I wanted to see how long I can last without eating meat since that was a huge part of my normal diet. I want to say the longest I went was about 3 months, I know I could've gone much longer than that but I told myself what was the point? It wasn't until this school year that I dramatically changed the amount of meat I have been consuming. I didn't give it much thought as to why these changes occurred but now that I think about it, it was more due to the fact that I am a lazy cooker and the process of defrosting meat and having to marinate and cook it, seems like way too much work for me so I no longer do it. I now incorporate a lot more plant based foods in my diet because it's just a lot easier for me - I would say plant based foods take up the majority of my plate. I find this very ironic how this change occurred within this school year and now I am taking a class on how beneficial these changes are not only for my diet but for the earth. Education and knowledge is key.

I agree with Ken's sobering thought that the majority of the American public will only want to combat climate change when their hand is forced and they have to. At that point it will have been to late to progressively go down a checklist of  the different things people do in their lives that emit carbon. Once the effects of the climate crisis become more and more devastating, people will end up having to give up so many thing in their lives that they are accustomed to in order to make a last chance effort to try and reduce the negative impact that they have already accrued on the earth. This is why I think as a nation if we took steps to ease off the the highest carbon-emitting practices to lowest, we have a better chance at preventing global catastrophe. The transition to becoming carbon neutral would not feel as drastic if we took small steps to achieve carbon neutrality. 
 <br><br>
On the topic of food, I think there is a negative association with being vegan/vegetarian when really there shouldn't be. The main argument that people use against these diets are the of "where do you get your protein from?" when in reality vegans have a wide variety of protein options. Even more so there are Olympic athletes and body builders, both require a lot of protein in their diet, that are able to compete with their meat-based diet counterparts. I have wondered why this negative association exist. I understand the hatred for the annoying vegan who has to tell everyone on the planet what their diet is, but that is more of a problem with the person rather than the diet. What Ken described was that American's do in fact have their own distinct culture of food and that is the abundance of beef infused into other culture's cuisines. This was accomplished by heavy advertising back in the day and has remained a large part of the American identity. I believe that a small change in diet could be one of the first baby steps that we take as a nation to reversing our carbon footprint as it is not a huge inconvenience on our daily lives to make this change.

I agree with all the points you made here. The main thing to take away from this lecture video is what Ken said about the climate crisis also being a behavioral issue. People will only start to fight for the planet and start changing their habits until they are absolutely forced to at the last minute. We definitely need to implement a carbon tax. We need elected officials who will strongly support this because it’s the only way people will listen and be forced to change their behavior and make more conscious decisions about their lifestyles. You are definitely right that we need to take small steps towards carbon neutrality. Although the climate crisis is a pressing issue and time is of the essence, people aren’t going to respond well to drastic changes. It’s already hard enough for some people to believe in the very concept of climate change so the way we go about implementing change is very important. 
 <br><br>

Food is tied to such cultural importance it’s a weird dichotomy to think about. Personally, my decision to cut off red meat made my hispanic family very worried about me. Like you said, they asked me the same thing, “where are you going to get your protein from? You’re going to get sick”. That question that families frequently ask shows the need for education and awareness. There are a lot of vegan friendly options and better sources of proteins than just getting them from meat. So while I grew up on Sunday carne asada’s, I feel like it’s a fair trade for the sake of all life on this planet. For others it’s not that simple. As you acknowledged from the video, meat is embedded in American culture. You cant associate an American without the all American hamburger. I guess it’s worth saying that going vegan or vegetarian isn’t just to help the environment, but to be healthier and reduce premature deaths linked to heart problems. But like Ken said, it’s going to take a wake up call for Americans to realize all of these encompassing side affects that are a result of our behavior.



<br><hr>
I believe the only way change is going to happen in the US is through environmental legislation. And that starts with what Ken mentions in the lecture, being a climate vanguard. Knowing what we (the students in this class) know, we need to spread our knowledge and try to inspire and influence others to change their habits. But the only way to get everyone on board is through legal steps. If these necessary changes become the law, people will have to obey. I completely agree with you in that we need to start by easing off the highest carbon-emitting practices and go from there. Sadly, in the United States, politics are very prevalent in every environmental policy that tries to pass. Ultimately, nothing can be done without the implementation of climate change policy into government and society. However, in the United States, the government requires agreement by the major parties to pass legislation, but since the majority party in both houses of Congress and the president are never part of the same party and never agree, progress stalls. People need to realize that political parties and climate change are two completely separate issues that shouldn’t be creating such dilemmas.
 <br><br>

I also completely agree with what you’re saying in terms of how negatively veganism/vegetarianism is seen. I have been vegetarian for 7 or so years, and still to this day I get questions about how I get enough protein or nutrients in general. I like to start with telling them that I swam competitively for six of those seven years, and never had a protein deficiency during the process. I always try to be understanding though when I’m asked these questions because a lot of people truly don’t know how to get protein other than protein from animals. And that is because beef and meat in general has become a huge part of American food culture. People have been eating animal products their whole life so it makes sense if they don’t know alternative ways to eat. That being said, that understanding stops when people have been given the information and then do nothing with it. I’m not saying everyone must become vegetarian immediately, but making an effort and starting to cut out meat little by little is the least someone could do. Like you said, a change in diet is one of the easiest ways to cut down our carbon footprint, and is one that won’t cause a huge inconvenience in our daily lives. I really do believe it’s the least people can do in terms of taking steps to solving the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I agree that there is a negative connotation with being vegetarian and especially vegan. I think this in part stems from the “annoying vegan” you mention and companies like PETA that have controversial reputations. You bring up a good point with how there are several competitive athletes thriving on plant-based diets. “The Game Changers” is a documentary available on Netflix that explores this specific topic. It opened my eyes to health benefits of going vegan as well as why there are some of these negative connotations. It goes into how meat has been marketed as a “manly” food. It is an interesting watch and I definitely recommend it.

<br><hr>
I agree with both points that you made here. I believe there needs to be a group of people trying to make a change now while reaching out to the rest of the population to join them. The second part of that sentence is extremely important thing because approaching the rest of the population trying to convince them to change their habits needs to be done in the right way. "I told you so" isn't going to cut it when we're all screwed anyways. We need to approach people and talk to them about simple things we have learned in this class towards creating a cleaner and greener climate.
 <br><br>
 As for the plant based diet, this is something that is very hard for people including myself. Something that I have become more aware of however, is the amount of beef and pork that I am eating. I have been trying to eat chicken only since I've learned that it has far less emissions than cows. This is an option to compromise with people who don't want to go to a strict plant diet.
<br><hr>
I also agree with everything you said here Zachary, I think this lecture video did a very good job explaining the ways the American way of life is hurting our planet. I agree with your statement saying that we have become accustomed to this environment killing the way of life, and it is naïve to think that people will willingly choose to change their ways. It would be incredible if everyone took climate change seriously enough to actually make changes, but unfortunately, that is highly unrealistic. You are right if we as a country took the steps towards preventing further climate change then it would be a great start. The everyday American has no choice but to follow the laws and do what the government says in. If they passed laws preventing companies from polluting our environments or paying a carbon tax then these things would help curve climate change immensely. It would have to be small steps because any huge radical change would scare the public and there would be so much push back, but little steps ensure people will have a nice slow change to their lifestyles. 
  <br><br>

Now on the subject of food, I think that people need to cut out red meat altogether, not only is it bad for the environment, but it is also not good for people to consume daily. There was a time when meaning was scarce, and only the rich could afford to eat it. They survived bac then and we can survive now without the daily consumption of meat. The only reason why people are scared of becoming vegan or vegetarian is that we are not introduced to it at a young age. We are raised to know that protein comes from meat and milk and that we need it to be healthy. Now if we started teaching kids “hey you can protein from a lot of foods like lentils, quinoa, peas, and so much more,” then the whole idea of eating a plant-based diet would be less intimidating.
<br><hr>
I agree that it’s definitely not a huge inconvenience to change our diets. I think it’s funny how people neglect to think about the health benefits before they go and criticize someone who doesn’t eat meat. I also agree that small steps right now are the best way to go rather than wait until the last minute. What makes the climate crisis especially hard is that every solution that is presented to the public gets shot down because people view it as violating freedom.  This situation makes it really difficult to uphold the old American ideal of freedom while also helping the planet. I think this situation calls for a collective group of people standing up and educating fellow citizens, people need to feel like it is their choice. The meat industry can't just be taken away, we need to slowly stop supporting it. Like Ken said smaller steps and gradual change gives us time to adapt and refine our solutions. Denmark is taking such great initiative in the situation, most people would have expected the U.S. to be this proactive in the climate crisis but we are completely lacking. America doesn't always have to be the best and we should take this opportunity to learn from other countries.

<br><hr>
You are right. Actually, not only Americans, I think most people all over the world will only want to combat climate change when they have to. In other words, quite few people are willing to give up their present pleasure for the uncertain future of the world. Unfortunately,  the sad reality is that more than half of the people are relatively selfish. It’s not the problem of the ability to distinguish right from wrong. Instead, the problem is that people generally lack willpower, and that is why we need laws. But making laws is not an easy thing as it seems to be. What we can do right now is to influence more people, not by words but by actions. I believe that is the meaning of the word “vanguard” here. Don't imagine this word too fantasy, someone needs to take the first step.
  <br><br>

Regarding the food, I believe there are mainly two reasons why people are unwilling to be vegan or vegetarian. #1. The need for protein: many people still have the stereotype that only meat can give us enough protein, which is important to keep us being healthy. #2. Why do people like eating meat? In most cases, people do not consider how much protein they can get from one meal. In fact, people choose what to eat based on the taste. One effective solution is to find out more ways to discover more vegetarian cooking methods. Most of the time, people are already tired of bland vegetable salads. If we create other ways to present vegetarian taste, I believe that people will spontaneously change to vegetarians.

To answer the question, yes I think we do. Because if we don't do it now, honestly, when will we ever? And will it be way too late by the; will people be fighting for a dying cause? Growing up, I always had some sort of carb, meat, and some sort of vegetable in my home for each meal. Never had any food waste because food that wasn't eaten was saved as leftovers and tomorrow's food. I thought that was normal. But I guess it really isn't all that normal in every household. How can you just throw away a third of your plate if you don't finish eating it? Aren't you gonna get hungry later or tomorrow? Do people really have the motivation to cook again? The amount of food waste created by a normal family is just insane. I know that a lot of the food doesn't even make it to the shelves of stores, but I didn't expect the food that made it to the shelves to be found in the trash can after cooking it for a meal. What I think is that we don't need any politics involved in shifting people's perspectives because I honestly think that views are too polarized to make that sort of change. What is needed is a cultural shift, and that sort of the thing takes years to create but we can and should start now. People need to start switching to more sustainable diets and buying only what they can eat. It might take a lot longer than we hoped for, but at least in a decade or two we will have made some significant progress.

growing up, I also did not produce a lot of food waste mostly because I didn't grow up with a lot of money, so we always made sure to value the foods we did eat and make the most of every meal. Now that I'm older I see how much waste is produced, and how it's everywhere around me. Especially in the freshman dining halls, if someone doesn't like the plate they got it's easy to just get up and grab another plate, and throw the first one away. Even in fast food places where just one portion is served, I always see garbage with half eaten fries, full drinks, and I wonder how much carbon was released to make that burger, only for it to end up in the garbage. I agree that we do need a climate vanguard. Food is such a personal choice, it's hard to get people to change their food choices when it's essentially the most important part of their day. I don't see any sweeping regulations regarding our food intake happening anytime soon, just because it's easy to try to justify one's choices when those choices are often times culturally engrained. My sister is vegan, and in Mexican households, it is disrespectful to decline food when it is offered to you. Whenever we visit a relatives household, she is always offered meat and is seen as disrespectful when she chooses to decline. Most of my family members know that she is vegan, but continue to offer her meals when they know it is an ethical choice that she personally made. People are very reluctant to change their habits, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't act altogether.

Climate change needs sweeping changes and reinventing culture. Most Americans most likely won’t do the changes because we have the privilege to decide the way we want to live. Ken gives advice on what we have to do like electing politicians to price carbon taxes on all product and services. Pricing carbon will increase air travel as it uses tons of greenhouse gases so many people will stop using planes. I know that flying does have a huge impact on our personal carbon footprint and I personally haven’t been in a plane for years, but the fact is that many people have families overseas and home out of state challenges this idea as plane is the only way of travel when going far. Being environmentally aware as a leader is crucial to the climate change, I just doubt that people are willing to completely do a 180 degree change in their lives. I would rather recommend trying changes and doing less for a longer time rather than being forced to do something for a short period of time. It also applies to diets as one cannot transition immediately into a vegan just in a day rather it is a process as Ken says, “it is not easy” and that is just the truth that change isn’t. It requires effort. Acting now is the best way to get knowledge out in our society at least because people will hear about the things that require attention.

I think it is crucial for us to start acting now because we don’t have a lot of time to waste. We are killing our planet one day at a time. I think a lot of people feel as though they can’t individually make a change to help the situation. They think that their individual actions won’t affect the planet because they are just a single person. However, this is the wrong mindset to have. If everyone were to have this same mindset, there would most definitely not be a change made. Acting now can be as simple as slowly changing our eating habits and limiting our food waste. Giving up meat completely is definitely a difficult challenge that I don’t think anyone could just jump into right away, but we can definitely start limiting the amount of meat we intake. By making these small changes, we can slowly start moving into the right direction of giving up meat all together. I thought it was interesting and relatable when Ken stated the example of a child wanting to switch to a plant based diet. I found this relatable because in the beginning of high school my mom wouldn’t let me become vegetarian. This wasn’t to do with me offending her cultural heritage, but instead was because she didn’t want to have to switch up her cooking style. I come from a combined family, meaning I have 5 siblings, so it would definitely be hard for my mom to make me “special meals” that didn’t include meat. She had to cook for a lot of people and didn’t have the time to make a separate meal for me. I totally understood this logic and asked her if we could maybe eat less meat and include more veggies into our meals. Without a fight, my mom agreed and we have been eating more veggies than meat ever since. With this being said, it is not that hard to start with the food issue and make a change today. Whether it be a small change (eating more veggies than meat) or a large change (cutting out meat), anything will help. Ken also mentioned climate labels in this lecture video which intrigued me. I think these climate labels would be essential and definitely help with the issue. A lot of people (including myself) don’t know exactly what foods are “good” for the planet and which foods are “bad”. Just by going vegetarian or vegan, this doesn’t mean that you are necessarily helping the planet. Most people aren’t aware of the dangers some foods cause and I think climate labels would help inform people.

I agree with the following comment and to agree that we must start acting now because we do not have much time to waste. Ken pointed out and I also agree that most Americans are not going to make the necessary changes until they are required to do so and are left with no other choice. We need to act now and establish the mindset today of electing politicians that will support pricing carbon so that the cost of products and services that require greenhouse gases will rise. We also need to start now in altering our lifestyle choices. Ken mentioned that most American diets have ample servings of meat products. This statement is true, and I can provide an example in which my family serves as an example of this. Last Thanksgiving my family gathered for dinner and it is of tradition to serve turkey at the dinner. However, as the years have progressed it has gone from one turkey for the longest time to now, as of last Thanksgiving, we had three turkeys. Now, my family is pretty large but I can even say that three turkeys are truly more than enough to serve each person and there were days worth of leftovers. With that being said, is it true that most Americans have ample amounts of meat products when gathered with their family members in eating. This then leads to food waste because the turkey can stay good for so long, and food waste is a huge problem and reducing this is extremely important. However, it is hard for many families and people, in general, to get out of the habit and look at food in an environmental aspect. I thought it was quite interesting and a good idea of Denmark who is trying to create climate labels to put on food that are like nutrition labels that will tell you how good or bad the food is, not for your body, but the environment. This is why I agree when Ken mentions we need national politicians to make enough of a change because just a small amount of people will not greater influence the world. We need help and support from elected officials and need to start now.

I totally agree with you that it is our generation’s duty to start to take action immediately, even just from some little things, like riding a bike to class instead of driving. And about our eating habits, it is so terrifying to learn that 80% of rainforest was destroyed for cattle and 1100 activists were gunned down to speak out against cattle ranching after watching the Cowspiracy. I am a little emotional after acknowledging that since I wasn’t aware of how serious the effects are, and it may even cause the deforestation. I even changed my attitude towards eating meats or being a vegetarian, since I never thought to be before. The whole shocking statistics and current facts also caused me to think other reasons to be vegetarians expect the environmental one. And I find that I believe animals have at least some moral status to be treated nicer and grow in natural circumstances. And I feel quite optimistic about this, since more and more people are now realizing this problem and we are all devoted to change the current situation.

Food is such an important component of the climate crisis that I, and others have ignored and taken for granted. It is astonishing that we have the luxury of casually wasting food while almost a billion people experience food insecurity. It goes back to the consequences of American consumerism because food has become virtually worthless to the financially stable because it is cheap. Most of us have grown up being told not to waste food, but in reality we still do, and in copious amounts. We can buy a meal for so cheap that there is no value to it. America overproduces so much food for no reason, just feeding into the fact that we can buy food we have no intention of eating. American culture does not promote “only what you need” in any way. That’s seen in the Costcos across America where you buy food in bulk and restaurants with portions double what it should be. The United States is the worst for overconsumption and it needs to be changed. We pride ourselves in huge steak dinners and burgers, gorging on meat. I am just as much part of the problem as I grew up eating lots of meat. 
  <br><br>
Being at UCSB has changed my eating habits though as the dining hall does offer healthier options by providing vegan burgers and lots of vegetarian options. Due to this class I have been trying to change my diet. While it is a small change, I have stopped eating beef burgers and have been going for the blend and vegan burgers in the dining hall. To many people who are vegan and vegetarian that is a miniscule change in diet and I should be doing more, but it is a step I have taken in cutting down on my beef consumption and I have talked to family and friends about doing the same and being more conscious of what we eat. While UCSB does have good plant based options, the issue of food waste is still major as there is a huge amount of food waste. As the dining halls close at certain hours, all the food left over from meals are just substituted out. I think the dining halls should remain open the whole day so people are able to go in when they want and if it’s between meals they can eat what would otherwise be thrown out from the last meal. It would help students that can’t eat in the three hour windows for meals and reduce food waste. The issue of food waste and meat consumption is so ingrained in American culture due to the artificially low prices that we truly do need a vanguard to change it. A handful of companies control American food production and that needs to change since they have so much pull over policies concerning agriculture and food. While it is extremely hard to change that without an entire economic and political revolution we can start by attempting to shift the demand curves for meat products and increase demand in plant based products by our own actions and encouraging others to do the same.

Largely plant based diets is but a mere pipe dream. Even if we educate everyone on the massive benefits itl have on the climate people won't listen. Man is inherently stubborn and will stick to their old and antiquated manners even if it kills them, literally. Offending family by not eating food of the culture due to your dietary restrictions or environment beliefs is an interesting subject I had not considered ever. I see both sides in that you should respect your heritage wherever possible but you should also be fully able to decide what does and does not go inside your body. The food industry, not only in America, is riddled with issues that will not go away unless there are major changes in our ways of life. What we eat has to change because at the current rate the beef industry alone will put us in ruins in the future. Even small changes over time such as slowly replacing the beef in meals with plant based meat will have a huge impact. It's great that there are companies currently working on that such as Beyond meat and Impossible burger. These companies truly go for a large portion of people that want to save the earth and know how bad beef is for it but don't want to give up the flavor. It's crazy what these companies can do in replicating the taste, smell, and even feeling of beef with purely plants.

I agree with Ken that realistically many people will not want to inconvenience themselves into making lifestyle changes in order to help reduce the climate crisis. It is interesting how the foods as Ken mentions how many cuisines that were brought to the U.S. were redesigned to include a lot of meat despite not being originally how they were prepared. It is very interesting how the industries in the U.S. changed it to become materialistic  and that has led to the large increase of waste. They changed the fashion  industry to become driven by obsolescence  to make more profits and the same is being done with the food industry. The industries make meat buying affordable so people buy more quantities.
    <br><br>
Actually today my dad went grocery shopping and he bought a lot of meat, probably more than what we actually need since the meat was not as expensive as it usually is. I think companies do this  once in a while to get the consumer to want to buy more. I grew up in a culture where meat is eaten a lot and is a big part of our diet and culture.I think we eat meat about every day.  I think it is very difficult to change things you have grown up with for so long and enjoy such as meals that contain meat. I do not think it is impossible though, yet if we can  ot make people go on a plant based diet we could at least promote a big reduction of meat weekly and have meat just not as often. Seeing the films, readings, and lecture videos has made me more aware of the negative impacts a heavy meat based diet has on the planet. I think knowing the negative impacts encourages to want to take the initiative to lay off  too much meat consumption and I think that is what we need.

Personal change is the only chance we have, but as sad as it is, many people will not be making these changes in their lifestyles because they don’t have the proper education on the climate crisis issue. Ken mentioned the carbon tax which seems very unlikely given how much political power the big gas and oil companies have. Theoretically, the tax is supposed to eventually cause certain means of transportation to become too expensive to use. However, this tax might take years to finally be passed and we simply don’t have that much time left to mitigate the climate crisis. What we need is a cultural change all over the globe. There is no excuse to take action as an individual. Ken stopped flying on airplanes despite having to go to academic conferences multiple times a year to present his work, yet he still managed to find a solution around this. We have so much technology that can create an almost face to face interaction that compares with an in-person conference. As a kid, I always ate the same food basically. My family, mainly because of my sister, ate more vegetables, fruits, and grains than meats. People don’t realize how good vegetables can be. I used to be a very picky eater, especially with vegetables, and now I cannot go a meal without eating them. Especially since moving to college and not being able to eat quality, and well-prepared meat I have slowly moved away from eating it even more than before. Another huge issue in this country that has its own problem attached is the proportions. Other countries meals are way smaller than our meal size and they do not have nearly as many people with obesity, heart disease or diabetes. People need to switch to eat locally grown foods and have a seasonal diet. A seasonal diet where you only eat the food that is able to be grown in your own place of living.

I believe that acting now is always better than waiting. Such as the same with procrastination, the longer the wait the more dire and stressed the situation becomes. Waiting in most cases is not helpful, and therefore I believe having a climate vanguard would be quite helpful because it would help set the standards for the rest of the world when they come around. These people could figure out the most convenient, yet efficient ways to change culture so that the planet will be saved. But also anything to help the environment right now is huge because the times are becoming very scary for the planet and change of any kind needs to happen. And if I thought the culture could change immediately I would rather have that, but it's just not possible and therefore we need leaders to lead to this eventual change. I’ve already started changing how I eat and act to help and I have not adopted any radical changes either, yet I have been able to shape a plan good for me after trying a couple things. This is such with me not eating beef anymore, being vegetarian on the weekends, and also slowing/stopping my consumerism with clothes and other unnecessary items. One thing that Ken mentioned in the video that I think should be adopted everywhere is the climate impact label on food because I think that would be very useful to people. It would really help people, even such as me who are lazy and don’t necessarily want to research every food item they buy to see where it comes from and other things. That would be very convenient and it could heavily influence what my family and I would buy when we go grocery shopping. Plus this could help lead to the culture change needed, which I think it is going to take a while, but this could definitely encourage it. In conclusion, having these climate vanguards would be helpful since it would push towards the needed change this world is dying for.

<p>
My answer to the title is not affirmative nor negative. I will give a maybe. Yes, we probably need some vanguards to lead us to the way we image, but are we all going to follow their lead? The word vanguard reminds me some lyrics: 
    <br><br>
"I saw these awful things in a documentary, decided I would stop eating meat.
    <br><br>
To save the planet 'til I was like "d**n it", I didn't even last a week."
    <br><br>
That is from Irony by Christopher. 
    <br><br>
Even though we may suddenly decide to switch our diet, can you promise that you will never switch again. I do not think so, because I am not that person, I do not think I can do it. Someone leads the trend; will everybody try to follow it? I am sure that someone will protect environment by following the way, but we need all people, all of the human to protect the planet not parts of them. I can see people are doing now, taking less air trips, promoting planet-friendly regulations. However, will the vanguard can really help with that? That is a tough question.

Ken mentioned that the majority of the American public will only commit to combating climate change when they have no other option. Like so many other aspects of life, humans tend to be quite selfish; if the issue isn't directly affecting them, they see no reason to change their behavior. Although it is true that I use primarily public transit and participate in a vegetarian diet, there are still many things I do that are not the best for the environment. I may recognize that what I'm doing isn't right, but there aren't any immediate consequences to my actions. Despite the negative impact of flying on the environment, I still fly fairly frequently; I'm from the east coast, so I typically fly 4-6 times a year just to get to and from school/home. Although there is the option to take multiple trains and buses to do the same trip, that's often more costly and time consuming, so I haven't done it. If I could force myself to implement a flying ban and commit to this other journey, I would be doing something better for the environment, but since it's less convenient, it's unlikely I'll do it anytime soon. 
    <br><br>

I may be aware of a number of things I can do to shrink my climate footprint, subconsciously, I still don't feel enough motivation to implement those changes into my routine. I don't know what it would be, but someone needs to come up with a motivation for change now before we're all racing against the clock a few decades from now.

You are so right.  Even when making an effort to reduce our impacts on the environment in the name of the climate crisis, there is always more that we can do.  However, without the motivation to do so, we are unlikely to change our habits.  It is good however that there are an increasing number of people who are trying to do what they can to reduce their impact.  Each little action contributes and helps in reducing the overall impact.  But it is true, we do need someone who is able to unite everyone and provide the motivation to change.  Otherwise people will continue their harmful ways, not seeing the impact of their actions, and the world will continue to suffer.  For this change, I think that it starts small with the changes that people are making in their daily lives right now and continue to become more and more environmentally conscious.  This in turn can spark mass change, and then the government and big corporations will have no choice but to follow suit.  I believe that this chain reaction has already begun, and now is the time for everyone who is making changes to become ambassadors for change.  With that, they can increase the number of those making the necessary changes.  There is no time to sit around and wait anymore, waiting for the impacts of our actions to become dangerously clear.  If we really ramp it up now then changes can be made before the impact is too severe.  I am hopeful that in time we will all make the necessary changes either on our own or through the advocacy of change by others before it is too late.

We do or we don’t. Helping the climate and acting on change should not be voluntary! It sucks because I don’t know when everyone will wake up and collectively act on the issue. This could all be happening right now. I never fly planes anyway and I do see how tremendously difficult it can be to change that but we should all have our priority and go step by step. 
    <br><br>
I admire how comitted Ken is. I like that he didn’t just stop at not flying, but going out of his way to experiment with online conferences and biking to work and so on. Is all that flying necessary half the time with all the online resources we have access to? We need climate labels that indicate the effects products have on the environment to allow people to understand and look past brands and advertisements. I took this course to learn and I’ve been inspired thus far.

Part of American culture is consumerism. I hate to say it but by the time the world agrees that action must be taken, it will be already too late. I think someone already explained it but we need a big culture change in this country. Hopefully, it starts with our generation. I strongly believe we are very educated on this subject and I say that because I see this type of information spread all over social media. If we can show that it works, people will wake up and follow the program.

Killing animals is unnecessary and cruel. There is no evidence that people should eat meat, dairy products, or eggs in order to be healthy and prosperous. This is an instinct unique to true meat-eaters such as animals that live in the wild. But for them, biologically there is no other food, while we humans have our alternatives.
      <br><br>
It goes without saying that animals do not want to die, they love and value life. And we, unfortunately, see them as "livestock", not thinking that they are, in fact, the same as our beloved pets like dogs and cats. When we understand this connection and take appropriate steps, we will be able to finally coordinate our actions with morality.
    <br><br>
A vegetarian diet can be very economical. When you focus your diet on grains, beans, nuts, seeds, seasonal fruits, and vegetables, you can cut your monthly food spendings by a lot. Many of these products can be stored for a long time and purchased in big amounts.
    <br><br>
 People would spend less if they thought through their diets, and did not grab a double cheeseburger on the run. We can come up with huge varieties of budget options for plant foods. Also, we do not have to spend a huge amount of money on doctors and medicines, since a plant-based diet can prevent diseases from happening. Overall, there are a lot of benefits of switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet: you are helping the environment, you are not hurting any animals, you are more healthy and slim, and also perhaps happier thanks to the other three factors.

Should we wait until everyone is on board? No, "everyone" won't be on board until each of us individually steps in to do our part. The whole is only the sum of its parts and we are the parts of the puzzle to mitigate climate change. I know I sound like an activist right now but I will be realistic. I think many Americans would be reluctant to switch to a plant based diet. However we can become reductionists who consume less meat and that would still be a step in the right direction. I publicly challenge myself to change my eating habits and Im writing it here to hold myself accountable. It actually makes you feel good to fuel your body with plants. We could solve more problems than just climate change with this approach. The obesity epidemic could be taken into control if people were mindful of their eating habits. I liked the idea of following in Denmark's footsteps by placing carbon labels on food products. I was surprised to discover that many of our fresh fruits and vegetables are actually flown in from other countries. I grew up in the agricultural capital of the world (Tulare County, CA) so I always grew up with fresh produce grown locally and I think I have taken that for granted. If Americans were to have home gardens they could grow their own food and reduce carbon emissions from the transportation of produce. This would also help with vitamin D deficiencies because people would spend more time outside. This could be a way of slowing down our busy lives to grow something for ourselves and our families.

I also think it will be difficult to persuade “every” American to change to a plant rich diet. I like your take on becoming a “reductionist” but I’m afraid that might not be enough. One of the guys they interviewed during the Cowspiracy documentary said having meatless Monday is a false justification. You’re either all in or all out. I feel like that is a little extreme, but he is right in some sense. I like how you bring in the obesity epidemic since that’s one of the biggest health issues we face in America today. The obesity epidemic is definitely tied in with the American diet as well. I’ve completely neglected it until you brought it up. If changing our diet could reduce the risk of obesity and save our planet, why aren’t more people participating? We need to change the stereotypical way of how Americans are being viewed by foreigners. We are being judged for our size and for our ways of living including eating. Again, when I think about imported goods, I have completely forgotten that process of transportation that was required to complete the transaction. And you’re absolutely right with growing things locally could help avoid these importations. I think farmers markets are a great place to start. I’ve always been a supporter for local businesses and I think this just gave me another reason to eat local and shop local.

I definitely agree with you that waiting for everyone to adjust accordingly for the climate is a futile and unrealistic goal. Back home, I would always struggle to convince my one friend to make environmentally safe choices- even if it was something as small as not using a plastic straw at a restaurant. I would remind her of its negative consequences, and she always responded, “when everyone else starts making the effort, then I will too.” Until the rest of the world changed their habits, she refused to make any personal sacrifices for the sake of the planet. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people share this mindset. This reinforces the significance of policy changes in the government, and as Ken has repeatedly mentioned, we must vote to bring about these new laws. Without them, we can, and should, continue to make individual choices that can reduce our own carbon footprint. People must change their mindset to believe that their own actions are important and can make a difference. Just like the quote from Jonathan Safran Foer that Ken mentions, you can begin by doing this at the breakfast table, and I think everyone should take this idea to heart.
<br><hr>
I agree with how you pointed out as to how we should not wait to face the issue of climate change until everyone else is on board. As Ken asked in the video, “Should we wait for the rest of the world to convert their cultural ways in response to the climate crisis?” The short answer is no, simply because I truly believe that the rest of the world is well aware of the damage that has been done due to the over demands of “first worlds”. They are trying to work against these changes. The U.S. being the most influential country in the world should be the ones taking the initiatives simply because they have the power to create greater change than the rest of the world. You bring up a really good point about how many Americans are reluctant to change to a plant based diet because of how the idea of eating meat has been engraved into our lifestyle for such a long time that it blurs our vision of imagining a life without consuming meat. I, too, am going to challenge myself to change my eating habits as a way to reduce my carbon footprint and to better my health in the long run. Also, make it a priority to waste less food because I tend to not finish the things I get.

The question shouldn’t be if we are willing to wait, but rather if the environment can wait. The climate crisis is not an issue that we as humans can dictate. We don’t have any say over when the next class five hurricane will hit or how many consecutive days there will be that break record temperature. Just because it’s caused by us, it doesn’t mean that we can control it. So, I think sweeping action needs to be taken now, no matter how many people are on board. There will never be a point at which everyone in our society agrees on the anthropogenic causes of climate change. As we’ve observed through history, support on climate action varies. At one point we have a president who wants to implement cap-and-trade policies, and the next we have one that thanks global warming for giving him a warm and sunny 70-degree day in fall. It’s irrational to dream of the day when everyone is on board with taking action to combat climate change because, at this point, we’re still struggling to get everyone to believe that climate change is real.

<br><br>
I would argue that the fight against climate change doesn’t necessarily require a full consensus. Sure, it would definitely help if everyone were to stop using cars and completely cut meat from their diet, but the reality is that that’s not going to happen. Although, what is necessary for this fight is the influence of politicians in office. The only way that lasting change will be made is if policies are put into place that forces people to adopt more sustainable habits. As much as we’d like to think that humanity can one day make the selfless act to put the environment before our own comforts, the truth is that human nature doesn’t really work that way anymore. By putting laws in place that, for example, put restrictions on portion sizes served at restaurants or the number of times someone can fill up their gas per week, it will force people to change their habits because they won’t have any other choice. The problem with this is that politicans would be a vital part of the process and they don’t always have the best reputation. This is what makes voting, even at the county level, so powerful in the battle against climate change. Like Ken said, by voting for officials who will support a carbon tax, climate action policies are inevitable.

I agree the goal is the carbon tax. A sweeping action will be the domino effect that is needed to save the environment. A carbon tax would make flying become less often used for transportation and the cost more expensive. Flying is one of the fastest and most harmful productions of CO2 emissions and is the result of the carbon tax, production would decrease. I see the issue of voting for green politicians because officials see it as a left or right issue. The environment isn't something political but it has been made that way. Reducing flying will decrease the amount of CO2 you're allotted for. Decreasing portions will create less food waste and less greenhouse gas emissions. The sad truth is that we won't make any of these changes till we're nearly too late or done for.
